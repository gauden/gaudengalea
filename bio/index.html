<h1>Dr Gauden Galea</h1>
<p>Dr. Gauden Galea is a global health expert focused on public health strategies for chronic disease prevention. A cancer survivor and public health physician, he also brings a passion for computer programming to his work.</p>
<p>He began his WHO career in 1998, serving in Suva, Manila, Geneva, Copenhagen, and Beijing. He served as Technical Officer for Healthy Islands (Pacific Islands and Territories, 1998–2000), Regional Adviser in NCDs (Manila, 2000–2006), and Coordinator of Health Promotion (Geneva, 2006–2010). He directed the Division of NCDs and Promoting Health through the Life‑Course in Europe (2011–2018), then served as WHO Representative in China (2018–2023). From March 2023 until his retirement in July 2025, he acted as Strategic Advisor to the WHO Europe Regional Director, leading the Special Initiative on Noncommunicable Diseases and Innovation.</p>
<p>With more than 25 years of leadership in public health, Dr. Galea has achieved significant advances in Europe and worldwide. He led the effort to document the commercial determinants of NCDs in Europe and led the team that developed the “Quick Buys for NCDs”, a suite of cost‑effective public health actions with swift payback. He also pioneered a national step‑wise model for NCD surveillance, integrated prevention and control of NCDs into health systems, and built the case for linking NCDs with global development goals. His work has informed life‑course health promotion and gender‑specific health action plans both in Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>He is a Fellow of the Faculty of Public Health (UK) and holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Malta.</p>
