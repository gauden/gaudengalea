The tagline, “Only Connect”, a <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/E._M._Forster">fragment from E. M. Forster</a>, provides a motto for this personal site, which serves as a sandbox and a hub, connecting my public health practice to extracurricular fields of interest.

I use this site to compile my occasional [writing and speeches](/blog), my peer-reviewed [papers](/pub), my [coding](/lab) experiments, and my updated [résumé](/bio). Do subscribe to my [RSS/Atom feed](/feed) if you are so inclined.
