{'AB': 'There is an increasing policy commitment to address the avoidable '
       'burdens of unhealthy diet, overweight and obesity. However, to design '
       'effective policies, it is important to understand why people make '
       'unhealthy dietary choices. Research from behavioural economics '
       'suggests a critical role for time discounting, which describes how '
       "people's value of a reward, such as better health, decreases with "
       'delay to its receipt. We systematically reviewed the literature on the '
       'relationship of time discounting with unhealthy diets, overweight and '
       'obesity in Web of Science and PubMed. We identified 41 studies that '
       'met our inclusion criteria as they examined the association between '
       'time discount rates and (i) unhealthy food consumption; (ii) '
       'overweight and (iii) response to dietary and weight loss '
       'interventions. Nineteen out of 25 cross-sectional studies found time '
       'discount rates positively associated with overweight, obesity and '
       'unhealthy diets. Experimental studies indicated that lower time '
       'discounting was associated with greater weight loss. Findings varied '
       'by how time discount rates were measured; stronger results were '
       'observed for food than monetary-based measurements. Network '
       'co-citation analysis revealed a concentration of research in nutrition '
       'journals. Overall, there is moderate evidence that high time '
       'discounting is a significant risk factor for unhealthy diets, '
       'overweight and obesity and may serve as an important target for '
       'intervention. (c) 2016 The Authors Obesity Reviews published by John '
