Homozygous Vangl2 mutation in mice prevents initiation of neural tube closure, precluding analysis of its subsequent roles in neurulation. Spinal neurulation involves rostral-to-caudal 'zippering' until completion of closure is imminent, when a caudal-to-rostral closure point, 'Closure 5', arises at the caudal-most extremity of the posterior neuropore (PNP). Here, we used Grhl3(Cre) to delete Vangl2 in the surface ectoderm (SE) throughout neurulation and in an increasing proportion of PNP neuroepithelial cells at late neurulation stages. This deletion impaired PNP closure after the approximately 25-somite stage and resulted in caudal spina bifida in 67% of Grhl3(Cre/+)Vangl2(Fl/Fl) embryos. In the dorsal SE, Vangl2 deletion diminished rostrocaudal cell body orientation, but not directional polarisation of cell divisions. In the PNP, Vangl2 disruption diminished mediolateral polarisation of apical neuroepithelial F-actin profiles and resulted in eversion of the caudal PNP. This eversion prevented elevation of the caudal PNP neural folds, which in control embryos is associated with formation of Closure 5 around the 25-somite stage. Closure 5 formation in control embryos is associated with a reduction in mechanical stress withstood at the main zippering point, as inferred from the magnitude of neural fold separation following zippering point laser ablation. This stress accommodation did not happen in Vangl2-disrupted embryos. Thus, disruption of Vangl2-dependent planar-polarised processes in the PNP neuroepithelium and SE preclude zippering point biomechanical accommodation associated with Closure 5 formation at the completion of PNP closure.", "CI": ["(c) 2018.

In vivo, we performed detailed microCT comparisons of bone structure in tibiae from young male mice heterozygous for NTD-associated mutations versus WT littermates. PCP signalling disruption caused by Vangl2 (Vangl2(Lp/+)) or Celsr1 (Celsr1(Crsh/+)) mutations significantly reduced trabecular bone mass and distal tibial cortical thickness. NTD-associated mutations in non-PCP transcription factors were also investigated. Pax3 mutation (Pax3(Sp2H/+)) had minimal effects on bone mass. Zic2 mutation (Zic2(Ku/+)) significantly altered the position of the tibia/fibula junction and diminished cortical bone in the proximal tibia. Beyond these genes, we bioinformatically documented the known extent of shared genetic networks between NTDs and bone properties. 46 genes involved in neural tube closure are annotated with bone-related ontologies.

Spina bifida lesions predominate in the distal spine, particularly after exposure to the anticonvulsant valproic acid (VPA). How VPA specifically disturbs late stages of neural tube closure is unclear, as neurulation is usually viewed as a uniform 'zippering' process along the spine. We recently identified a novel closure site (\"Closure 5\") which forms at the caudal extremity of the mouse posterior neuropore (PNP) when completion of closure is imminent. Here we investigated whether distal spina bifida in VPA-exposed embryos involves disruption of Closure 5. Exposure of E8.5 mouse embryos to VPA in whole embryo culture had marked embryotoxic effects, whereas toxic effects were less pronounced in more developmentally advanced (E9) embryos. Only 33% of embryos exposed to VPA from E9 to E10.5 achieved PNP closure (control=90%). Short-term (8h) VPA treatment diminished supra-cellular F-actin cables which normally run along the lateral neural folds, and prevented caudal PNP narrowing normally characteristic of Closure 5 formation. Laser ablation of Closure 5 caused rapid neuropore widening. Equivalent ablations of the caudal PNP in VPA treated embryos resulted in significantly less widening, suggesting VPA prevents formation of Closure 5 as a biomechanically active structure. Thus, VPA exposure prevents morphological and biomechanical conversion of the caudal extreme of the PNP during late spinal closure. Closure 5 facilitates neural fold apposition when completion of closure is imminent, such that its disruption in VPA-exposed embryos may lead to distal spina bifida.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Failure of this closure process leads to open spina bifida, a common cause of severe neurologic disability in humans. Here, we combined a tissue-level strain-mapping workflow with laser ablation of live-imaged mouse embryos to investigate the biomechanics of mammalian spinal closure. Ablation of the zippering point at the embryonic dorsal midline causes far-reaching, rapid separation of the elevating neural folds. Strain analysis revealed tissue expansion around the zippering point after ablation, but predominant tissue constriction in the caudal and ventral neural plate zone. This zone is biomechanically coupled to the zippering point by a supracellular F-actin network, which includes an actin cable running along the neural fold tips. Pharmacologic inhibition of F-actin or laser ablation of the cable causes neural fold separation. At the most advanced somite stages, when completion of spinal closure is imminent, the cable forms a continuous ring around the neuropore, and simultaneously, a new caudal-to-rostral zippering point arises.

One group of aged, 19-month-old female C57BL/6 mice was given 0, 25, 50 or 100mug/kg/day iPTH for 4weeks. Histological and muCT analysis of their tibiae revealed potent iPTH dose-related increases in periosteally-enclosed area, cortical area and porosity with decreased cortical thickness. There was practically no effect on trabecular bone. Another group was given a submaximal dose of 50mug/kg/day iPTH or vehicle for 2 or 6weeks with loading of their right tibia three times per week for the final 2weeks. In the trabecular bone of these mice the loading-related increase in BV/TV was abrogated by iPTH primarily by reduction of the increase in trabecular number. In their cortical bone, iPTH treatment time-dependently increased cortical porosity. Loading partially reduced this effect. The osteogenic effects of iPTH and loading on periosteally-enclosed area and cortical area were additive but not synergistic. Thus in aged, unlike young mice, iPTH and loading appear to have separate effects. iPTH alone causes a marked increase in cortical porosity which loading reduces. Both iPTH and loading have positive effects on cortical periosteal bone formation but these are additive rather than synergistic.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The 14 most frequently SoHO-transmitted bacteria identified through a scoping literature review were then prioritized during an expert workshop through a methodology based on multicriteria decision analysis. The selection of the prioritization method was based upon an ECDC framework for best practices in conducting risk-ranking exercises. Three transmission pathways, blood and blood components, tissues and cells, and organs, were considered in the ranking exercise. RESULTS: According to the ranking score (RS), bacteria were organized within each SoHO pathway into one of four risk tiers: Tier 1 (RS >/= 0.70), Tier 2 (RS = 0.60-0.69), Tier 3 (RS = 0.40-0.59), or Tier 4 (RS < 0.40). The most consistently identified pathogens in the highest risk Tiers 1 and 2 of all three pathways were: Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas spp., and Acinetobacter spp. CONCLUSION: Six bacteria were defined as being of the highest priority in respect of the threat to the safety of SoHO and will be the subject of subsequent in-depth risk assessments to be conducted by ECDC to identify measures to mitigate the risk posed by these bacteria.", "CI": ["(c) 2017 AABB."], "FAU": ["Domanovic, Dragoslav", "Cassini, Alessandro", "Bekeredjian-Ding, Isabelle", "Bokhorst, Arlinke", "Bouwknegt, Martijn", "Facco, Giuseppina", "Galea, George", "Grossi, Paolo", "Jashari, Ramadan", "Jungbauer, Christoph", "Marcelis, Jan", "Raluca-Siska, Ioana", "Andersson-Vonrosen, Inger", "Suk, Jonathan E"], "AU": ["Domanovic D", "Cassini A", "Bekeredjian-Ding I", "Bokhorst A", "Bouwknegt M", "Facco G", "Galea G", "Grossi P", "Jashari R", "Jungbauer C", "Marcelis J", "Raluca-Siska I", "Andersson-Vonrosen I", "Suk JE"], "AD": "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Stockholm, Sweden.

Here we investigate transcriptomic changes associated with this impaired adaptive response. Young adult (19-week-old) and aged (19-month-old) female mice were subjected to unilateral axial tibial loading and their cortical shells harvested for microarray analysis between 1h and 24h following loading (36 mice per age group, 6 mice per loading group at 6 time points). In non-loaded aged bones, down-regulated genes are enriched for MAPK, Wnt and cell cycle components, including E2F1. E2F1 is the transcription factor most closely associated with genes down-regulated by ageing and is down-regulated at the protein level in osteocytes. Genes up-regulated in aged bone are enriched for carbohydrate metabolism, TNFalpha and TGFbeta superfamily components. Loading stimulates rapid and sustained transcriptional responses in both age groups. However, genes related to proliferation are predominantly up-regulated in the young and down-regulated in the aged following loading, whereas those implicated in bioenergetics are down-regulated in the young and up-regulated in the aged. Networks of inter-related transcription factors regulated by E2F1 are loading-responsive in both age groups. Loading regulates genes involved in similar signalling cascades in both age groups, but these responses are more sustained in the young than aged. From this we conclude that cells in aged bone retain the capability to sense and transduce loading-related stimuli, but their ability to translate acute responses into functionally relevant outcomes is diminished.", "CI": ["Copyright A(c) 2016 The Authors.

Results: In 44 out of 54 studies, smokers more greatly discounted the future than non-smokers and, in longitudinal studies, higher discounting predicted future smoking. Smokers with lower time-discount rates achieved higher quit rates. Findings were consistent across studies measuring discount rates using hypothetical monetary or cigarette reward scenarios. The methodological quality of the majority of studies was rated as 'moderate' and co-citation analysis revealed an isolation of economics journals and a dearth of studies in public health. Conclusion: There is moderate yet consistent evidence that high time-discounting is a risk factor for smoking and unsuccessful cessation. Policy scenarios assuming a flat rate of population discounting may inadequately capture smokers' perceptions of costs and benefits.", "CI": ["(c) The Author 2016; Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the", "International Epidemiological Association"], "FAU": ["Barlow, Pepita", "McKee, Martin", "Reeves, Aaron", "Galea, Gauden", "Stuckler, David"], "AU": ["Barlow P", "McKee M", "Reeves A", "Galea G", "Stuckler D"], "AD": "Department of Sociology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

Although the precise mechanisms remain unclear, Wnt signalling pathway components, and the anti-osteogenic canonical Wnt inhibitor Sost/sclerostin in particular, play an important role in regulating bone's adaptive response to loading. Increases in loading-engendered strains down-regulate osteocyte sclerostin expression, whereas reduced strains, as in disuse, are associated with increased sclerostin production and bone loss. However, while sclerostin up-regulation appears to be necessary for the loss of bone with disuse, the role of sclerostin in the osteogenic response to loading is more complex. While mice unable to down-regulate sclerostin do not gain bone with loading, Sost knockout mice have an enhanced osteogenic response to loading. The molecular mechanisms by which osteocytes sense and transduce loading-related stimuli into changes in sclerostin expression remain unclear but include several, potentially interlinked, signalling cascades involving periostin/integrin, prostaglandin, estrogen receptor, calcium/NO and Igf signalling. Deciphering the mechanisms by which changes in the mechanical environment regulate sclerostin production may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies that can reverse the skeletal structural deterioration characteristic of disuse and age-related osteoporosis and enhance bones' functional adaptation to loading. By enhancing the osteogenic potential of the context in which individual therapies such as sclerostin antibodies act it may become possible to both prevent and reverse the age-related skeletal structural deterioration characteristic of osteoporosis.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

However, to design effective policies, it is important to understand why people make unhealthy dietary choices. Research from behavioural economics suggests a critical role for time discounting, which describes how people's value of a reward, such as better health, decreases with delay to its receipt. We systematically reviewed the literature on the relationship of time discounting with unhealthy diets, overweight and obesity in Web of Science and PubMed. We identified 41 studies that met our inclusion criteria as they examined the association between time discount rates and (i) unhealthy food consumption; (ii) overweight and (iii) response to dietary and weight loss interventions. Nineteen out of 25 cross-sectional studies found time discount rates positively associated with overweight, obesity and unhealthy diets. Experimental studies indicated that lower time discounting was associated with greater weight loss. Findings varied by how time discount rates were measured; stronger results were observed for food than monetary-based measurements. Network co-citation analysis revealed a concentration of research in nutrition journals. Overall, there is moderate evidence that high time discounting is a significant risk factor for unhealthy diets, overweight and obesity and may serve as an important target for intervention.

METHODS: A scoping review explored the extent, range and nature of three types of physical activity-related evidence available in reviews: (I) health outcomes/risk factors, (II) interventions and (III) policy-making. A six-step qualitative, iterative process with expert consultation guided data coding and analysis in EPPI Reviewer 4. RESULTS: 856 Type I reviews, 350 Type II reviews and 40 Type III reviews were identified. Type I reviews heavily focused on obesity issues (18 %). Reviews of a systematic nature were more prominent in the Type II (>50 %). Type III reviews tended to conflate research about policy intervention effectiveness and research about policymaking processes. The majority of reviews came from the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. CONCLUSIONS: Although evidence gaps exist regarding evidence Types I and II, the most prominent gap regards Type III, i.e. research pertaining to physical activity policymaking.

Homozygous Vangl2 mutation in mice prevents initiation of neural tube closure, precluding analysis of its subsequent roles in neurulation. Spinal neurulation involves rostral-to-caudal 'zippering' until completion of closure is imminent, when a caudal-to-rostral closure point, 'Closure 5', arises at the caudal-most extremity of the posterior neuropore (PNP). Here, we used Grhl3(Cre) to delete Vangl2 in the surface ectoderm (SE) throughout neurulation and in an increasing proportion of PNP neuroepithelial cells at late neurulation stages. This deletion impaired PNP closure after the approximately 25-somite stage and resulted in caudal spina bifida in 67% of Grhl3(Cre/+)Vangl2(Fl/Fl) embryos. In the dorsal SE, Vangl2 deletion diminished rostrocaudal cell body orientation, but not directional polarisation of cell divisions. In the PNP, Vangl2 disruption diminished mediolateral polarisation of apical neuroepithelial F-actin profiles and resulted in eversion of the caudal PNP. This eversion prevented elevation of the caudal PNP neural folds, which in control embryos is associated with formation of Closure 5 around the 25-somite stage. Closure 5 formation in control embryos is associated with a reduction in mechanical stress withstood at the main zippering point, as inferred from the magnitude of neural fold separation following zippering point laser ablation. This stress accommodation did not happen in Vangl2-disrupted embryos. Thus, disruption of Vangl2-dependent planar-polarised processes in the PNP neuroepithelium and SE preclude zippering point biomechanical accommodation associated with Closure 5 formation at the completion of PNP closure.", "CI": ["(c) 2018.

Here, we first confirmed that core Wnt/PCP components are expressed in osteoblasts and osteoclasts in vitro. In vivo, we performed detailed microCT comparisons of bone structure in tibiae from young male mice heterozygous for NTD-associated mutations versus WT littermates. PCP signalling disruption caused by Vangl2 (Vangl2(Lp/+)) or Celsr1 (Celsr1(Crsh/+)) mutations significantly reduced trabecular bone mass and distal tibial cortical thickness. NTD-associated mutations in non-PCP transcription factors were also investigated. Pax3 mutation (Pax3(Sp2H/+)) had minimal effects on bone mass. Zic2 mutation (Zic2(Ku/+)) significantly altered the position of the tibia/fibula junction and diminished cortical bone in the proximal tibia. Beyond these genes, we bioinformatically documented the known extent of shared genetic networks between NTDs and bone properties. 46 genes involved in neural tube closure are annotated with bone-related ontologies.

Spina bifida lesions predominate in the distal spine, particularly after exposure to the anticonvulsant valproic acid (VPA). How VPA specifically disturbs late stages of neural tube closure is unclear, as neurulation is usually viewed as a uniform 'zippering' process along the spine. We recently identified a novel closure site (\"Closure 5\") which forms at the caudal extremity of the mouse posterior neuropore (PNP) when completion of closure is imminent. Here we investigated whether distal spina bifida in VPA-exposed embryos involves disruption of Closure 5. Exposure of E8.5 mouse embryos to VPA in whole embryo culture had marked embryotoxic effects, whereas toxic effects were less pronounced in more developmentally advanced (E9) embryos. Only 33% of embryos exposed to VPA from E9 to E10.5 achieved PNP closure (control=90%). Short-term (8h) VPA treatment diminished supra-cellular F-actin cables which normally run along the lateral neural folds, and prevented caudal PNP narrowing normally characteristic of Closure 5 formation. Laser ablation of Closure 5 caused rapid neuropore widening. Equivalent ablations of the caudal PNP in VPA treated embryos resulted in significantly less widening, suggesting VPA prevents formation of Closure 5 as a biomechanically active structure. Thus, VPA exposure prevents morphological and biomechanical conversion of the caudal extreme of the PNP during late spinal closure. Closure 5 facilitates neural fold apposition when completion of closure is imminent, such that its disruption in VPA-exposed embryos may lead to distal spina bifida.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Consequently, the femoral head bone is not processed, is not sterilised and at the time of issue, it contains donor blood, bone marrow and associated cells. We have previously shown that, cut, shaped and washed bone from deceased donors can be processed to remove up to 99.9% of blood, bone marrow and associated cells (Eagle et al. 2015). However, cut and shaped bone is not suitable for some orthopaedic procedures and some orthopaedic surgeons do not wish to use irradiated bone; therefore in this report, a method has been developed in which whole femoral heads can be washed to remove donor blood and bone marrow components. Processing results in excess of 99% bone marrow component removal-soluble protein, haemoglobin and DNA; the procedure is performed inside a closed system, thereby eliminating the need for terminal sterilisation by irradiation.

Failure of this closure process leads to open spina bifida, a common cause of severe neurologic disability in humans. Here, we combined a tissue-level strain-mapping workflow with laser ablation of live-imaged mouse embryos to investigate the biomechanics of mammalian spinal closure. Ablation of the zippering point at the embryonic dorsal midline causes far-reaching, rapid separation of the elevating neural folds. Strain analysis revealed tissue expansion around the zippering point after ablation, but predominant tissue constriction in the caudal and ventral neural plate zone. This zone is biomechanically coupled to the zippering point by a supracellular F-actin network, which includes an actin cable running along the neural fold tips. Pharmacologic inhibition of F-actin or laser ablation of the cable causes neural fold separation. At the most advanced somite stages, when completion of spinal closure is imminent, the cable forms a continuous ring around the neuropore, and simultaneously, a new caudal-to-rostral zippering point arises. Laser ablation of this new closure initiation point causes neural fold separation, demonstrating its biomechanical activity. Failure of spinal closure in pre-spina bifida Zic2(Ku) mutant embryos is associated with altered tissue biomechanics, as indicated by greater neuropore widening after ablation.

One group of aged, 19-month-old female C57BL/6 mice was given 0, 25, 50 or 100mug/kg/day iPTH for 4weeks. Histological and muCT analysis of their tibiae revealed potent iPTH dose-related increases in periosteally-enclosed area, cortical area and porosity with decreased cortical thickness. There was practically no effect on trabecular bone. Another group was given a submaximal dose of 50mug/kg/day iPTH or vehicle for 2 or 6weeks with loading of their right tibia three times per week for the final 2weeks. In the trabecular bone of these mice the loading-related increase in BV/TV was abrogated by iPTH primarily by reduction of the increase in trabecular number. In their cortical bone, iPTH treatment time-dependently increased cortical porosity. Loading partially reduced this effect. The osteogenic effects of iPTH and loading on periosteally-enclosed area and cortical area were additive but not synergistic. Thus in aged, unlike young mice, iPTH and loading appear to have separate effects. iPTH alone causes a marked increase in cortical porosity which loading reduces. Both iPTH and loading have positive effects on cortical periosteal bone formation but these are additive rather than synergistic.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) organized an expert consultation, with the objective of developing a priority list of bacterial pathogens transmissible via SoHO.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The 14 most frequently SoHO-transmitted bacteria identified through a scoping literature review were then prioritized during an expert workshop through a methodology based on multicriteria decision analysis. The selection of the prioritization method was based upon an ECDC framework for best practices in conducting risk-ranking exercises. Three transmission pathways, blood and blood components, tissues and cells, and organs, were considered in the ranking exercise. RESULTS: According to the ranking score (RS), bacteria were organized within each SoHO pathway into one of four risk tiers: Tier 1 (RS >/= 0.70), Tier 2 (RS = 0.60-0.69), Tier 3 (RS = 0.40-0.59), or Tier 4 (RS < 0.40). The most consistently identified pathogens in the highest risk Tiers 1 and 2 of all three pathways were: Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas spp., and Acinetobacter spp. CONCLUSION: Six bacteria were defined as being of the highest priority in respect of the threat to the safety of SoHO and will be the subject of subsequent in-depth risk assessments to be conducted by ECDC to identify measures to mitigate the risk posed by these bacteria.", "CI": ["(c) 2017 AABB."], "FAU": ["Domanovic, Dragoslav", "Cassini, Alessandro", "Bekeredjian-Ding, Isabelle", "Bokhorst, Arlinke", "Bouwknegt, Martijn", "Facco, Giuseppina", "Galea, George", "Grossi, Paolo", "Jashari, Ramadan", "Jungbauer, Christoph", "Marcelis, Jan", "Raluca-Siska, Ioana", "Andersson-Vonrosen, Inger", "Suk, Jonathan E"], "AU": ["Domanovic D", "Cassini A", "Bekeredjian-Ding I", "Bokhorst A", "Bouwknegt M", "Facco G", "Galea G", "Grossi P", "Jashari R", "Jungbauer C", "Marcelis J", "Raluca-Siska I", "Andersson-Vonrosen I", "Suk JE"], "AD": "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Stockholm, Sweden.

Here we investigate transcriptomic changes associated with this impaired adaptive response. Young adult (19-week-old) and aged (19-month-old) female mice were subjected to unilateral axial tibial loading and their cortical shells harvested for microarray analysis between 1h and 24h following loading (36 mice per age group, 6 mice per loading group at 6 time points). In non-loaded aged bones, down-regulated genes are enriched for MAPK, Wnt and cell cycle components, including E2F1. E2F1 is the transcription factor most closely associated with genes down-regulated by ageing and is down-regulated at the protein level in osteocytes. Genes up-regulated in aged bone are enriched for carbohydrate metabolism, TNFalpha and TGFbeta superfamily components. Loading stimulates rapid and sustained transcriptional responses in both age groups. However, genes related to proliferation are predominantly up-regulated in the young and down-regulated in the aged following loading, whereas those implicated in bioenergetics are down-regulated in the young and up-regulated in the aged. Networks of inter-related transcription factors regulated by E2F1 are loading-responsive in both age groups. Loading regulates genes involved in similar signalling cascades in both age groups, but these responses are more sustained in the young than aged. From this we conclude that cells in aged bone retain the capability to sense and transduce loading-related stimuli, but their ability to translate acute responses into functionally relevant outcomes is diminished.", "CI": ["Copyright A(c) 2016 The Authors.

An explanation originating in behavioural economics suggests a role for time-discounting, which describes how the value of a reward, such as better health, decreases with delay to its receipt. A large number of studies test the relationship of time-discounting with tobacco outcomes but the temporal pattern of this relationship and its variation according to measurement methods remain unclear. We review the association between time-discounting and smoking across (i) the life course, from initiation to cessation, and (ii) diverse discount measures. Methods: We identified 69 relevant studies in Web of Science and PubMed. We synthesized findings across methodologies and evaluated discount measures, study quality and cross-disciplinary fertilization. Results: In 44 out of 54 studies, smokers more greatly discounted the future than non-smokers and, in longitudinal studies, higher discounting predicted future smoking. Smokers with lower time-discount rates achieved higher quit rates. Findings were consistent across studies measuring discount rates using hypothetical monetary or cigarette reward scenarios. The methodological quality of the majority of studies was rated as 'moderate' and co-citation analysis revealed an isolation of economics journals and a dearth of studies in public health. Conclusion: There is moderate yet consistent evidence that high time-discounting is a risk factor for smoking and unsuccessful cessation.

Although the precise mechanisms remain unclear, Wnt signalling pathway components, and the anti-osteogenic canonical Wnt inhibitor Sost/sclerostin in particular, play an important role in regulating bone's adaptive response to loading. Increases in loading-engendered strains down-regulate osteocyte sclerostin expression, whereas reduced strains, as in disuse, are associated with increased sclerostin production and bone loss. However, while sclerostin up-regulation appears to be necessary for the loss of bone with disuse, the role of sclerostin in the osteogenic response to loading is more complex. While mice unable to down-regulate sclerostin do not gain bone with loading, Sost knockout mice have an enhanced osteogenic response to loading. The molecular mechanisms by which osteocytes sense and transduce loading-related stimuli into changes in sclerostin expression remain unclear but include several, potentially interlinked, signalling cascades involving periostin/integrin, prostaglandin, estrogen receptor, calcium/NO and Igf signalling. Deciphering the mechanisms by which changes in the mechanical environment regulate sclerostin production may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies that can reverse the skeletal structural deterioration characteristic of disuse and age-related osteoporosis and enhance bones' functional adaptation to loading. By enhancing the osteogenic potential of the context in which individual therapies such as sclerostin antibodies act it may become possible to both prevent and reverse the age-related skeletal structural deterioration characteristic of osteoporosis.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

However, to design effective policies, it is important to understand why people make unhealthy dietary choices. Research from behavioural economics suggests a critical role for time discounting, which describes how people's value of a reward, such as better health, decreases with delay to its receipt. We systematically reviewed the literature on the relationship of time discounting with unhealthy diets, overweight and obesity in Web of Science and PubMed. We identified 41 studies that met our inclusion criteria as they examined the association between time discount rates and (i) unhealthy food consumption; (ii) overweight and (iii) response to dietary and weight loss interventions. Nineteen out of 25 cross-sectional studies found time discount rates positively associated with overweight, obesity and unhealthy diets. Experimental studies indicated that lower time discounting was associated with greater weight loss. Findings varied by how time discount rates were measured; stronger results were observed for food than monetary-based measurements. Network co-citation analysis revealed a concentration of research in nutrition journals. Overall, there is moderate evidence that high time discounting is a significant risk factor for unhealthy diets, overweight and obesity and may serve as an important target for intervention.

This article aims to present the achievements and challenges of tobacco control in Europe, focussing on the available legally binding instruments such as the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive at the European Union level. Tobacco still faces heavy lobbying of the tobacco industry, which has systematically contrasted policies to achieve public health objectives.

It aims to refine the distinction between three types of evidence relating to physical activity and to compare these types for the purpose of clarifying potential research gaps. METHODS: A scoping review explored the extent, range and nature of three types of physical activity-related evidence available in reviews: (I) health outcomes/risk factors, (II) interventions and (III) policy-making. A six-step qualitative, iterative process with expert consultation guided data coding and analysis in EPPI Reviewer 4. RESULTS: 856 Type I reviews, 350 Type II reviews and 40 Type III reviews were identified. Type I reviews heavily focused on obesity issues (18 %). Reviews of a systematic nature were more prominent in the Type II (>50 %). Type III reviews tended to conflate research about policy intervention effectiveness and research about policymaking processes. The majority of reviews came from the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. CONCLUSIONS: Although evidence gaps exist regarding evidence Types I and II, the most prominent gap regards Type III, i.e. research pertaining to physical activity policymaking.

Wnt16 acts on osteoblasts and osteoclasts and, in cortical bone, is predominantly derived from osteoblasts. This led us to hypothesize that low bone mass would be associated with low levels of Wnt16 expression and that Wnt16 expression would be increased by anabolic factors, including mechanical loading. We therefore investigated Wnt16 expression in the context of ageing, mechanical loading and unloading, estrogen deficiency and replacement, and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) depletion. Quantitative real time PCR showed that Wnt16 mRNA expression was lower in cortical bone and marrow of aged compared to young female mice. Neither increased nor decreased (by disuse) mechanical loading altered Wnt16 expression in young female mice, although Wnt16 expression was decreased following ovariectomy. Both 17beta-estradiol and the Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator Tamoxifen increased Wnt16 expression relative to ovariectomy. Wnt16 and ERbeta expression were increased in female ERalpha-/- mice when compared to Wild Type. We also addressed potential effects of gender on Wnt16 expression and while the expression was lower in the cortical bone of aged males as in females, it was higher in male bone marrow of aged mice compared to young. In the kidney, which we used as a non-bone reference tissue, Wnt16 expression was unaffected by age in either males or females. In summary, age, and its associated bone loss, is associated with low levels of Wnt16 expression whereas bone loss associated with disuse has no effect on Wnt16 expression. In the artificially loaded mouse tibia we observed no loading-related up-regulation of Wnt16 expression but provide evidence that its expression is influenced by estrogen receptor signaling. These findings suggest that while Wnt16 is not an obligatory contributor to regulation of bone mass per se, it potentially plays a role in influencing pathways associated with regulation of bone mass during ageing and estrogen withdrawal.", "FAU": ["Todd, Henry", "Galea, Gabriel L", "Meakin, Lee B", "Delisser, Peter J", "Lanyon, Lance E", "Windahl, Sara H", "Price, Joanna S"], "AU": ["Todd H", "Galea GL", "Meakin LB", "Delisser PJ", "Lanyon LE", "Windahl SH", "Price JS"], "AD": "School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.

It is estimated that this cancer burden could be reduced by up to one half if scientific knowledge on causes of cancer could be translated into successful prevention. The Code is a preventive tool aimed to reduce the cancer burden by informing people how to avoid or reduce carcinogenic exposures, adopt behaviours to reduce the cancer risk, or to participate in organised intervention programmes. The Code should also form a base to guide national health policies in cancer prevention. The 12 recommendations are: not smoking or using other tobacco products; avoiding second-hand smoke; being a healthy body weight; encouraging physical activity; having a healthy diet; limiting alcohol consumption, with not drinking alcohol being better for cancer prevention; avoiding too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation; avoiding cancer-causing agents at the workplace; reducing exposure to high levels of radon; encouraging breastfeeding; limiting the use of hormone replacement therapy; participating in organised vaccination programmes against hepatitis B for newborns and human papillomavirus for girls; and participating in organised screening programmes for bowel cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2015 International Agency for Research on Cancer.

The effectiveness of this process declines with age and bones become fragile fracturing with less force. This effect in humans also occurs in mice which experience age-related bone loss and reduced adaptation to loading. Exercise engenders many systemic and local muscular physiological responses as well as engendering local bone strain. To investigate whether these physiological responses influence bones' adaptive responses to mechanical strain we examined whether a period of treadmill exercise influenced the adaptive response to an associated period of artificial loading in young adult (17-week) and old (19-month) mice. After treadmill acclimatization, mice were exercised for 30 min three times per week for two weeks. Three hours after each exercise period, right tibiae were subjected to 40 cycles of non-invasive axial loading engendering peak strain of 2250 muepsilon. In both young and aged mice exercise increased cross-sectional muscle area and serum sclerostin concentration. In young mice it also increased serum IGF1. Exercise did not affect bone's adaptation to loading in any measured parameter in young or aged bone. These data demonstrate that a level of exercise sufficient to cause systemic changes in serum, and adaptive changes in local musculature, has no effect on bone's response to loading 3h later. This study provides no support for the beneficial effects of exercise on bone in the elderly being mediated by systemic or local muscle-derived effects rather than local adaptation to altered mechanical strain.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

However, it is well established that the effects of axial loading produce site-specific changes throughout bones' structure. Non-mechanical influences (e.g., hormones) can be additional to or oppose locally controlled adaptive responses and may have more generalized effects. Tools currently available to study site-specific cortical bone adaptation are limited. Here, we applied novel site specificity software to measure bone mass and architecture at each 1% site along the length of the mouse tibia from standard micro-computed tomography (muCT) images. Resulting measures are directly comparable to those obtained through muCT analysis (R (2) > 0.96). Site Specificity analysis was used to compare a number of parameters in tibiae from young adult (19-week-old) versus aged (19-month-old) mice; ovariectomized and entire mice; limbs subjected to short periods of axial loading or disuse induced by sciatic neurectomy. Age was associated with uniformly reduced cortical thickness and site-specific decreases in cortical area most apparent in the proximal tibia. Mechanical loading site-specifically increased cortical area and thickness in the proximal tibia. Disuse uniformly decreased cortical thickness and decreased cortical area in the proximal tibia. Ovariectomy uniformly reduced cortical area without altering cortical thickness. Differences in polar moment of inertia between experimental groups were only observed in the proximal tibia. Aging and ovariectomy also altered eccentricity in the distal tibia. In summary, site specificity analysis provides a valuable tool for measuring changes in cortical bone mass and architecture along the entire length of a bone. Changes in the (re)modeling response determined at a single site may not reflect the response at different locations within the same bone.", "FAU": ["Galea, Gabriel L", "Hannuna, Sion", "Meakin, Lee B", "Delisser, Peter J", "Lanyon, Lance E", "Price, Joanna S"], "AU": ["Galea GL", "Hannuna S", "Meakin LB", "Delisser PJ", "Lanyon LE", "Price JS"], "AD": "School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol , Bristol , UK.

By reducing background loading, aged bone's response to loading increased to a level no different to young mice. This suggests, given the right stimulus, that ageing bone can respond to mechanical loading. INTRODUCTION: Age-related decline in bone mass has been suggested to represent an impaired ability of bone to adapt to its mechanical environment. In young mice, the tibia's response to external mechanical loading has been shown to increase when habitual activity is reduced by sciatic neurectomy. Here we investigate if neurectomy can rescue bone's response to loading in old mice. METHODS: The effect of tibial disuse, induced by unilateral sciatic neurectomy (SN), on the adaptive response to a single peak magnitude of dynamic load-engendered mechanical strain was assessed in 19-month-old (aged) mice. In a second experiment, a range of peak loads was used to assess the load magnitude-related effects of loading on a background of disuse in young adult and aged mice. Bone architecture was analysed using micro-computed tomography (muCT) and dynamic histomorphometry. RESULTS: In the first experiment, SN in aged mice was associated with a significant periosteal osteogenic response to loading not observed in sham-operated mice (7.98 +/- 1.7 vs 1.02 +/- 2.2 % increase in periosteally enclosed area, p < 0.05). In the second experiment, SN abrogated the expected age-related difference in the bones' osteogenic response to peak strain magnitude (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that bones' age-related decline in osteogenic responsiveness to loading does not originate in bone cells to either assess, or appropriately respond to strain, but rather is likely to be due to inhibitory \"averaging\" effects derived from the habitual strains to which the bone is already adapted. If such \"strain averaging\" is applicable to humans, it suggests that gentle exercise may degrade the beneficially osteogenic effects of short periods of more vigorous activity.", "FAU": ["Meakin, L B", "Delisser, P J", "Galea, G L", "Lanyon, L E", "Price, J S"], "AU": ["Meakin LB", "Delisser PJ", "Galea GL", "Lanyon LE", "Price JS"], "AD": "School of Veterinary Science, University of Bristol, Langford, Bristol, BS40 5DU, UK. lee.meakin@bristol.ac.uk.

Here, we report that brief exposure to dynamic substrate strain (sufficient to rapidly stimulate cell division) influences the orientation of osteoblastic cell division. The initial proliferative response to strain involves canonical Wnt signaling and can be blocked by sclerostin. However, the strain-related orientation of cell division is independently influenced through the noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. Blockade of Rho-associated coiled kinase (ROCK), a component of the PCP pathway, prevents strain-related orientation of division in osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells. Heterozygous loop-tail mutation of the core PCP component van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2) in mouse osteoblasts impairs the orientation of division in response to strain. Examination of bones from Vangl2 loop-tail heterozygous mice by microCT and scanning electron microscopy reveals altered bone architecture and disorganized bone-forming surfaces. Hence, in addition to the well-accepted role of PCP involvement in response to developmental cues during skeletal morphogenesis, our data reveal that this pathway also acts postnatally, in parallel with canonical Wnt signaling, to transduce biomechanical cues into skeletal adaptive responses. The simultaneous and independent actions of these two pathways appear to influence both the rate and orientation of osteoblast division, thus fine-tuning bone architecture to meet the structural demands of functional loading.", "CI": ["(c) 2014 The Authors.

The role of the protein kinase PKCalpha in this process has not been previously reported. However, we observed a phenotype in the long bones of Prkca(-/-) female but not male mice, in which bone tissue progressively invades the medullary cavity in the mid-diaphysis. This bone deposition progresses with age and is prevented by disuse but unaffected by ovariectomy. Castration of male Prkca(-/-) but not WT mice results in the formation of small amounts of intramedullary bone. Osteoblast differentiation markers and Wnt target gene expression were up-regulated in osteoblast-like cells derived from cortical bone of female Prkca(-/-) mice compared with WT. Additionally, although osteoblastic cells derived from WT proliferate following exposure to estradiol or mechanical strain, those from Prkca(-/-) mice do not. Female Prkca(-/-) mice develop splenomegaly and reduced marrow GBA1 expression reminiscent of Gaucher disease, in which PKC involvement has been suggested previously. From these data, we infer that in female mice, PKCalpha normally serves to prevent endosteal bone formation stimulated by load bearing. This phenotype appears to be suppressed by testicular hormones in male Prkca(-/-) mice. Within osteoblastic cells, PKCalpha enhances proliferation and suppresses differentiation, and this regulation involves the Wnt pathway.

Increases in obesity are a major cause of NCDs. This paper projects the future burden of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, type 2 diabetes and seven cancers by 2030 in 53 WHO European Region countries based on current and past body mass index (BMI) trends. It also tests the impact of obesity interventions on the future disease burden. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Secondary data analysis of country-specific epidemiological data using a microsimulation modelling process. INTERVENTIONS: The effect of three hypothetical scenarios on the future burden of disease in 2030 was tested: baseline scenario, BMI trends go unchecked; intervention 1, population BMI decreases by 1%; intervention 2, BMI decreases by 5%. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantifying the future burden of major NCDs and the impact of interventions on this future disease burden. RESULTS: By 2030 in the whole of the European region, the prevalence of diabetes, CHD and stroke and cancers was projected to reach an average of 3990, 4672 and 2046 cases/100 000, respectively. The highest prevalence of diabetes was predicted in Slovakia (10 870), CHD and stroke-in Greece (11 292) and cancers-in Finland (5615 cases/100 000). A 5% fall in population BMI was projected to significantly reduce cumulative incidence of diseases. The largest reduction in diabetes and CHD and stroke was observed in Slovakia (3054 and 3369 cases/100 000, respectively), and in cancers was predicted in Germany (331/100 000). CONCLUSIONS: Modelling future disease trends is a useful tool for policymakers so that they can allocate resources effectively and implement policies to prevent NCDs. Future research will allow real policy interventions to be tested; however, better surveillance data on NCDs and their risk factors are essential for research and policy.", "CI": ["Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This study aimed to investigate whether there were transplant-associated vCJD cases in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: Medical histories were reviewed for 177 UK vCJD cases to identify situations where the transplantation of organs or tissues might have occurred. A \"look-back\" was then performed to trace the respective donors or recipients of the implicated organ or tissue. RESULTS: A single patient had undergone an organ (liver) transplant before vCJD onset, from a donor who had died of causes unrelated to vCJD. The look-back was able to trace six other organ or tissue donations made by the same donor. No other situations were identified where the receipt or donation of organs or tissues had occurred in people who went on to develop vCJD. There was considered no need, on this particular occasion, to implement public health measures associated with the organ transplantation, beyond those already in place.

This mechanism appears less effective with age, resulting in low bone mass. In male and female young adult (17-week-old) and old (19-month-old) mice, we investigated the effect of age in vivo on bones' adaptive response to loading and in vitro in primary cultures of osteoblast-like cells derived from bone cortices. Right tibias were axially loaded on alternate days for 2 weeks. Left tibias were non-loaded controls. In a separate group, the number of sclerostin-positive osteocytes and the number of periosteal osteoblasts were analyzed 24 hours after a single loading episode. The responses to strain of the primary osteoblast-like cells derived from these mice were assessed by EGR2 expression, change in cell number and Ki67 immunofluorescence. In young male and female mice, loading increased trabecular thickness and the number of trabecular connections. Increase in the number of trabecular connections was impaired with age but trabecular thickness was not. In old mice, the loading-related increase in periosteal apposition of the cortex was less than in young ones. Age was associated with a lesser loading-related increase in osteoblast number on the periosteal surface but had no effect on loading-related reduction in the number of sclerostin-positive osteocytes. In vitro, strain-related proliferation of osteoblast-like cells was lower in cells from old than young mice. Cells from aged female mice demonstrated normal entry into the cell cycle but subsequently arrested in G2 phase, reducing strain-related increases in cell number. Thus, in both male and female mice, loading-related adaptive responses are impaired with age. This impairment is different in females and males.

In such cases, the burden of proof is on the potential partners to show that their activities are health enhancing. Second, do potential partners put their policies into practice in the settings where they can do so, their own workplaces?

Such clarification remains elusive but studies have confirmed ligand-independent involvement of ERs as facilitators in a number of the pathways by which mechanical strain stimulates osteoblast proliferation and bone formation. The presence of alpha and beta forms of ER that oppose, supplement or replace one another has complicated interpretation of studies to identify their individual roles when both are present in normal amounts. However, it appears that, in mice at least, ERalpha promotes cortical bone mass in both males and females through its effects in early members of the osteoblast lineage, but enhances loading-related cortical bone gain only in females. In addition to its role as a potential replacement for ERalpha, and modifier of ERalpha activity, the less well-studied ERbeta appears to facilitate rapid early effects of strain including activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and downregulation of Sost in well-differentiated cells of the osteoblast lineage including osteocytes. If these different roles are substantiated by further studies, it would appear that under normal circumstances ERalpha contributes primarily to the size and extent of bones' osteogenic response to load bearing through facilitating anabolic influences in osteoblasts and osteoblast progenitors, whereas ERbeta is more involved in the strain-related responses generated within resident cells including osteocytes.", "FAU": ["Galea, Gabriel L", "Price, Joanna S", "Lanyon, Lance E"], "AU": ["Galea GL", "Price JS", "Lanyon LE"], "AD": "School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol , Bristol, UK.

METHODS: We used multivariate linear regression to estimate the association between soft drink consumption and overweight, obesity, and diabetes prevalence in 75 countries, controlling for other foods (cereals, meats, fruits and vegetables, oils, and total calories), income, urbanization, and aging. Data were obtained from the Euromonitor Global Market Information Database, the World Health Organization, and the International Diabetes Federation.

Here, we investigate the differential effects of ERalpha and -beta in these processes in mouse long bone-derived osteoblastic cells and human Saos-2 cells. Recruitment to the cell cycle following strain or 17beta-estradiol occurs within 30 min, as determined by Ki-67 staining, and is prevented by the ERalpha antagonist 1,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-[4-(2-piperidinylethoxy)phenol]-1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride. ERbeta inhibition with 4-[2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-beta]pyrimidin-3-yl] phenol (PTHPP) increases basal proliferation similarly to strain or estradiol. Both strain and estradiol down-regulate Sost expression, as does in vitro inhibition or in vivo deletion of ERalpha. The ERbeta agonists 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile and ERB041 also down-regulated Sost expression in vitro, whereas the ERalpha agonist 4,4',4''-[4-propyl-(1H)-pyrazol-1,3,5-triyl]tris-phenol or the ERbeta antagonist PTHPP has no effect. Tamoxifen, a nongenomic ERbeta agonist, down-regulates Sost expression in vitro and in bones in vivo. Inhibition of both ERs with fulvestrant or selective antagonism of ERbeta, but not ERalpha, prevents Sost down-regulation by strain or estradiol. Sost down-regulation by strain or ERbeta activation is prevented by MEK/ERK blockade. Exogenous sclerostin has no effect on estradiol-induced proliferation but prevents that following strain. Thus, in osteoblastic cells the acute proliferative effects of both estradiol and strain are ERalpha-mediated. Basal Sost down-regulation follows decreased activity of ERalpha and increased activity of ERbeta. Sost down-regulation by strain or increased estrogens is mediated by ERbeta, not ERalpha.

It is axiomatic that bones will only show an adaptive response if the applied artificial loading environment differs in a significant way from that to which the bones have been habituated by normal functional loading. It is generally assumed that this normal loading is similar between experimental groups. In the study reported here we found that this was not always the case. Male and female 17-week-old C57BL/6 mice were housed in groups of six, and a single episode (40 cycles) of non-invasive axial loading, engendering 2,200 muepsilon on the medial surface of the proximal tibiae in sample mice, was applied to right tibiae on alternate days for two weeks. This engendered an adaptive increase in bone mass in females, but not males. Observation revealed the main difference in behaviour between males and females was that males were involved in fights 1.3 times per hour, whereas the females never fought. We therefore housed all mice individually. In females, there was a similar significant osteogenic response to loading in cortical and trabecular bone of both grouped and individual mice. In contrast, in males, adaptive increases in the loaded compared with non-loaded control bones was only apparent in animals housed individually. Our interpretation of these findings is that the frequent vigorous fighting that occurs between young adult males housed in groups could be sufficient to engender peak strains and strain rates that equal or exceed the stimulus derived from artificial loading. This indicates the importance of ensuring that physical activity is consistent between groups. Reducing the background level of the naturally engendered strain environment allows adaptive responses to artificial loading to be demonstrated at lower loads.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, a transition to Western diets has been suggested as an alternative driver. We sought to determine what socio-economic and dietary factors are the most significant population-level contributors to diabetes prevalence rates internationally. DESIGN: Multivariate regression models were used to study how market sizes of major food products (sugars, cereals, vegetable oils, meats, total joules) corresponded to diabetes prevalence, incorporating lagged and cumulative effects. The underlying social determinants of food market sizes and diabetes prevalence rates were also studied, including ageing, income, urbanization, overweight prevalence and imports of foodstuffs. SETTING: Data were obtained from 173 countries. SUBJECTS: Population-based survey recipients were the basis for diabetes prevalence and food market data. RESULTS: We found that increased income tends to increase overall food market size among low- and middle-income countries, but the level of food importation significantly shifts the content of markets such that a greater proportion of available joules is composed of sugar and related sweeteners. Sugar exposure statistically explained why urbanization and income have been correlated with diabetes rates.

Evidence to support this theory is circumstantial. We investigated the possibility that the \"lazy zone\" is an artifact and that, across the range of normal strain experience, features of bone architecture associated with strength are linearly related in size to their strain experience. Skeletally mature female C57BL/6 mice were right sciatic neurectomized to minimize natural loading in their right tibiae. From the fifth day, these tibiae were subjected to a single period of external axial loading (40, 10-second rest interrupted cycles) on alternate days for 2 weeks, with a peak dynamic load magnitude ranging from 0 to 14 N (peak strain magnitude: 0-5000 microepsilon) and a constant loading rate of 500 N/s (maximum strain rate: 75,000 microepsilon/s). The left tibiae were used as internal controls. Multilevel regression analyses suggest no evidence of any discontinuity in the progression of the relationships between peak dynamic load and three-dimensional measures of bone mass/strength in both cortical and cancellous regions. These are essentially linear between the low-peak locomotor strains associated with disuse ( approximately 300 microepsilon) and the high-peak strains derived from artificial loading and associated with the lamellar/woven bone transition ( approximately 5000 microepsilon).

In female ERalpha(-/-) mice, the net-osteogenic response to loading was lower in cortical bone compared with their wild-type littermates (11.2 vs. 20.9% in ERalpha(+/+)), but it was higher in both cortical and cancellous bone of male ERalpha(-/-) mice (cortical 20.0 vs. 4.6% in ERalpha(+/+); cancellous 30.0 vs. 5.3% in ERalpha(+/+), P < 0.05).

Tissue collection programmes were established in the mid-1990s, and the range of tissues collected has increased progressively over the years. MATHODS: Whilst the majority of tissues are obtained from cadaveric donations, bone is collected only from living donors who are usually patients undergoing primary hip replacement surgery (surgical donors). The bone is collected in an operating theatre, and, once stored, no further processing takes place prior to issue. Bone that fails for any reason (quality, microbiology or virological nonnegative result) is discarded. RESULTS: The deferral rate amongst live surgical bone donors in Scotland is around 65%, and it has been slowly and progressively rising from around 55% over the past few years. This needed investigated, particularly because comparisons with blood donors show that the deferral rate amongst bone donors is more than double that of first-time blood donors (29.7%). Our processes and systems are standardised, and our cohort of bone bank nurses have all been similarly trained and competency assessed. Moreover our data collection was done in a uniform fashion. It was therefore possible to conduct a 6-year audit on bone donor deferrals. It was found that a history of transfusion (16%), history of malignancy (18%) and bone quality (26%) were the main reasons for bone donor deferrals, accounting for 60% of all deferrals. CONCLUSIONS: When these are taken into account, the residual deferral rates become very similar numerically to blood donors. It is important to note however that there are significant differences between the blood and bone donor cohorts. This study also highlighted some of deferral reasons. Particularly malignancy is a cause of significant numbers of deferrals, and the evidence of transmissibility of malignancy through bone donation is not strong. More robust risk assessments should be undertaken prior to implementing deferral conditions.", "FAU": ["Galea, George"], "AU": ["Galea G"], "AD": "Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, Tissues and Cells Directorate, Edinburgh, UK.", "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20111118", "PL": "Switzerland", "TA": "Transfus Med Hemother", "JT": "Transfusion medicine and hemotherapy : offizielles Organ der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie", "JID": "101176417", "PMC": "PMC3268000", "EDAT": "2012/03/10 06:00", "MHDA": "2012/03/10 06:00", "CRDT": ["2012/03/10 06:00"], "PHST": ["2011/09/14 00:00 [received]", "2011/11/03 00:00 [accepted]", "2012/03/10 06:00 [entrez]", "2012/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]", "2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1159/000334892 [doi]", "000334892 [pii]"], "PST": "ppublish", "SO": "Transfus Med Hemother. 2011 Dec;38(6):373-378. doi: 10.1159/000334892.

We show that daily NS-398 injection does not influence bone gain from repeated loading in female mice. INTRODUCTION: Prostaglandins are mediators of bone cells' early response to mechanical stimulation. COX-2 expression is up-regulated by exposure of these cells to mechanical strain or fluid flow, and the osteogenic response to a single loading period is reduced by COX-2 inhibition. This study determined, in female mice in vivo, the effect of longer term COX-2 inhibition on adaptive (re)modelling of cortical and trabecular bone in response to repeated loading. METHODS: Nineteen-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with vehicle or NS-398 (5 mg/kg/day) 5 days a week for 2 weeks. On three alternate days each week, the right tibiae/fibulae were axially loaded [40 cycles (7 min)/day] three hours after injection. Left limbs acted as internal controls. Changes in three-dimensional bone architecture were analysed by high-resolution micro-computed tomography. RESULTS: In control limbs NS-398 was associated with reduced trabecular number but had no influence on cortical bone. In loaded limbs trabecular thickness and cortical periosteally enclosed volume increased. NS-398 showed no effect on this response. CONCLUSION: Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 by NS-398 does not affect trabecular or cortical bone's response to repeated mechanical loading in female mice and thus would not be expected to impair the functional adaptation of bone to physical activity in women.", "FAU": ["Sugiyama, T", "Meakin, L B", "Galea, G L", "Lanyon, L E", "Price, J S"], "AU": ["Sugiyama T", "Meakin LB", "Galea GL", "Lanyon LE", "Price JS"], "AD": "Department of Veterinary Basic Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, University of London, London, UK.

Recent publication of the UK experience of transplanting organs from CNS tumor donors found no transmission in 448 recipients of organs from 177 donors with a primary CNS tumor (Watson et al., Am J Transplant 2010; 10: 1437).

Real time quantitative PCR confirmed up-regulation of Egr2 mRNA expression by loading of the tibia in vivo. In vitro studies where strain was applied to primary cultures of mouse tibia-derived osteoblastic cells and the osteoblast UMR106 cell line also showed up-regulation of Egr2 mRNA expression. In UMR106 cells, inhibition of beta1/beta3 integrin function had no effect on strain-related Egr2 expression, but it was inhibited by a COX2-selective antagonist and imitated by exogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This response to PGE(2) was mediated chiefly through the EP1 receptor and involved stimulation of PKC and attenuation by cAMP/PKA. Neither activators nor inhibitors of nitric oxide, estrogen signaling, or LiCl had any effect on Egr2 mRNA expression, but it was increased by both insulin-like growth factor-1 and high, but not low, dose parathyroid hormone and exogenous Wnt-3a. The increases by strain, PGE2, Wnt-3a, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were attenuated by inhibition of MEK-1. EGR2 appears to be involved in many of the signaling pathways that constitute early responses of bone cells to strain. These pathways all have multiple functions.

Seventeen-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were given daily subcutaneous injections of vehicle (n=20) or risedronate at a dose of 0.15, 1.5, 15 or 150 mug/kg/day (n=10 in each) for 17 days. From the fourth day of treatment, the right tibiae were subjected to a single period of axial loading (40 cycles/day) for three alternate days per week for two weeks. The left tibiae were used as internal controls. Trabecular and cortical sites in the tibiae were analyzed by high-resolution micro-computed tomography and imaging of fluorochrome labels. In the non-loaded tibiae, treatment with the higher doses of risedronate at 15 or 150 mug/kg/day resulted in higher trabecular bone volume and trabecular number than in vehicle-treated controls, whereas such treatment was associated with no differences in cortical bone volume at any dose. In the loaded tibiae, loading induced increases in trabecular and cortical bone volume compared with contra-lateral controls primarily through increased trabecular thickness and periosteal expansion, respectively, independently of risedronate treatment. In conclusion, the response to mechanical loading in both trabecular and cortical bone in mice is therefore not impaired by short-term treatment with risedronate, even over a 1000-fold dose range.

The increasing global crisis in NCDs is a barrier to development goals including poverty reduction, health equity, economic stability, and human security. The Lancet NCD Action Group and the NCD Alliance propose five overarching priority actions for the response to the crisis--leadership, prevention, treatment, international cooperation, and monitoring and accountability--and the delivery of five priority interventions--tobacco control, salt reduction, improved diets and physical activity, reduction in hazardous alcohol intake, and essential drugs and technologies. The priority interventions were chosen for their health effects, cost-effectiveness, low costs of implementation, and political and financial feasibility. The most urgent and immediate priority is tobacco control. We propose as a goal for 2040, a world essentially free from tobacco where less than 5% of people use tobacco. Implementation of the priority interventions, at an estimated global commitment of about US$9 billion per year, will bring enormous benefits to social and economic development and to the health sector.

Twelve donated femoral heads were divided into halves and milled into bone chips. One half of the bone chips were washed with pulse lavage, whereas, the other half acted as control. In order to determine the amount of protein, fat and dsDNA present in the washed and unwashed samples, a validated multistep washing protocol was used. Using the validated technique, simple intra-operative washing of morcellised unprocessed bone allograft removed a significant amount of the protein (70.5%, range: 39.5-85%), fat (95.2%, range: 87.8-98.8%) and DNA (68.4%, range: 31.4-93.1%) content.

Ten days after actual or sham ovariectomy, 17-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice were treated with vehicle (peanut oil), tamoxifen (0.02, 0.2, or 2 mg/kg . d), fulvestrant (4 mg/kg . d), or their combination and the right tibiae subjected to a short period of noninvasive axial loading (40 cycles/d) on 5 d during the subsequent 2 wk. In the left control tibiae, ovariectomy, tamoxifen, or fulvestrant did not have any significant effect on cortical bone volume, whereas trabecular bone volume was decreased by ovariectomy, increased by tamoxifen, and unaffected by fulvestrant. In the right tibiae, loading was associated with increases in both trabecular and cortical bone volume. Notably, the medium dose of tamoxifen synergistically enhanced loading-related gain in trabecular bone volume through an increase in trabecular thickness. Fulvestrant had no influence on the effects of loading but abrogated the enhancement of loading-related bone gain by tamoxifen.

Initially impaction grafting was undertaken using fresh frozen femoral head allografts that were milled to create morselized bone pieces that could be impacted to create a neo-cancellous bone bed prior to cementation of the new implant. Results of medium and long term outcome studies have shown variable results using this technique.

SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1985 to 2008), EMBASE (1985 to 2008), CINAHL(1985 to 2008) and the National Research Register. Additional sources were also searched. Handsearching of relevant journals and conference abstracts was also undertaken. Searches were complete to 31 August 2008.

The goal of this project is to explore the opportunity of filling this gap through developing and trial of a personal digital assistant (PDA) based data collection/entry system. It evaluated whether such a system could increase efficiency and reduce data transcription errors for public surveillance data collection in developing countries represented by Fiji. METHODS: A generic PDA-based data collection software eSTEPS was developed. The software and the data collected using it directly interfaces with EpiData. A field trial was conducted to test the viability of public health surveillance data collection using eSTEPS. The design was a randomised, controlled trial with cross-over design. 120 participants recruited from the Fiji School of Medicine were randomly assigned to be interviewed by one of six interviewers in one of the two ways: (1) paper-based survey followed by PDA survey and (2) PDA survey followed by paper-based survey. Data quality was measured by error rates (logical range errors/inconsistencies, skip errors, missing values, date or time field errors and incorrect data type). Work flow and cost were evaluated in three stages of the survey process: (1) preparation of data collection instrument, (2) data collection and (3) data entry, validation and cleaning. User acceptance was also evaluated in the two groups of participants: (1) data collectors and (2) survey participants. RESULTS: None of the errors presented in 20.8% of the paper questionnaires was found in the data set collected using PDA. Sixty-two percent of the participants perceived that the PDA-based questionnaire took less time to complete. Data entry, validation and cleaning for the PDA-based data collection from 120 participants took a total of 1.5h, a 93.26% reduction of time from 20.5h required using paper and pen. The cost is also significantly reduced with PDA-based protocol. Both data collectors and participants prefer to use PDA instead of paper for data collection. The trial results prove that eSTEPS is a feasible solution for public health surveillance data collection in the field. Several deficiencies of the software were also identified and would be addressed in the next version. CONCLUSION: eSTEPS offers the potential to meet the need for an effective mobile public health data collection tool for use in the field. The eSTEPS field trial proves that PDA was more efficient than paper for public health survey data collection. It also significantly reduced errors in data entry. The later benefit was derived from the software providing its users with the flexibility of building their own constraints to control the data type, range and logic of data entry.", "FAU": ["Yu, Ping", "de Courten, Maximilian", "Pan, Elaine", "Galea, Gauden", "Pryor, Jan"], "AU": ["Yu P", "de Courten M", "Pan E", "Galea G", "Pryor J"], "AD": "School of Information Systems and Technology, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia. ping@uow.edu.au", "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Validation Studies"], "DEP": "20090415", "PL": "Ireland", "TA": "Int J Med Inform", "JT": "International journal of medical informatics", "JID": "9711057", "SB": "IM", "MH": ["*Computers, Handheld", "Cross-Over Studies", "Data Collection/*methods", "*Developing Countries", "Humans", "*Population Surveillance", "*Public Health Practice"], "EDAT": "2009/04/17 09:00", "MHDA": "2009/09/02 06:00", "CRDT": ["2009/04/17 09:00"], "PHST": ["2008/06/23 00:00 [received]", "2009/03/05 00:00 [revised]", "2009/03/05 00:00 [accepted]", "2009/04/17 09:00 [entrez]", "2009/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]", "2009/09/02 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["S1386-5056(09)00039-2 [pii]", "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.03.002 [doi]"], "PST": "ppublish", "SO": "Int J Med Inform. 2009 Aug;78(8):532-42. doi: 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.03.002.

In the case of the latter, it is especially critical that standards for clinically assisted reproduction be harmonized with those governing human cell and tissue transplantation, most notably with respect to procurement, donation, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of cells. In the UK, existing infrastructure to address these considerations is undergoing extensive reorganization to keep pace with evolving European Union standards. The present best paradigm for defining standards for the therapeutic use of embryo-derived stem cells is experience with adult haematopoietic stem cells (HSC). However, compared with adult-derived stem cell, the origin of embryo-derived stem cells from limiting quantities of tissue and their absolute dependence on in vitro culture to realise their therapeutic potential, makes optimization of their isolation and cultivation of even greater importance. Most notable is the requirement to create animal cell product-free culture environments to reduce the risk of cross-specific disease transmission.

Due to concerns regarding the possibility of disease transmission from donor to recipient, and of contamination of grafts during retrieval and processing procedures, it is common practice to sterilise bone allografts prior to issue for clinical use. It is vital that the sterilisation processes applied to allografts are validated to demonstrate that they achieve the required level of bioburden reduction, and by extension that validated models are used for these studies. Two common sterilisation protocols applied to bone allografts are gamma irradiation and ethylene oxide gas sterilisation, and there are currently no validated models available for measuring the anti-viral efficacy of ethylene oxide treatment with regard to bone allografts or readily useable models for assessing the anti-viral efficiency of gamma irradiation treatment. We have developed and validated models for both these sterilisation processes, using the bacteriophage varphix174, and utilised the models to measure the antiviral activity of the standard ethylene oxide and gamma irradiation sterilisation processes applied to bone allografts by the National Blood Service. For the irradiation model, we also utilised bacterial spores (Bacillus pumilus). Our results show that ethylene oxide sterilisation (which can only be applied to lyophilised grafts) inactivated > 6.1 log(10) of the model virus, and gamma irradiation (at 25 -40 kGy and applied to frozen allografts) inactivated 3.6 - 4.0 log(10) of the model virus and > 4 log(10) of the bacterial spores.

In the Pacific region, young people are exposed to similar causes of ill-health as their peers in developed countries. This paper describes the development, implementation and major findings of the Health Behaviour and Lifestyle of Pacific Youth (HBLPY) surveys, a regional initiative to obtain representative data about health-related behaviour and needs of adolescents in Vanuatu, Tonga and the Federated States of Micronesia. The Pacific HBLPY is modelled on the WHO Europe Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) surveys. The surveys, undertaken in 2000-2001, were built upon strong local partnerships and were undertaken with youth participation to ensure survey ownership. A regional technical group was formed to provide training and support to strengthen health survey capacity of youth and their agencies. The findings showed that tobacco was most commonly used substance, with 29.7% of 15-year-old boys and 15.7% of girls smoking weekly. Over half of the students did not engage in physical activity for at least 2 h per week; these rates are substantially lower than those usually found in Europe. Dietary habits among this group are also of concern, reflecting international trends away from highly nutritious traditional diets. The HBLPY surveys have shown that it is possible to collect population-based data in lower- and middle-income countries so that appropriate youth health programmes and policies can be developed. Implementation of an ongoing surveillance system similar to the HBLPY model in these countries warrants further investigation. Such initiatives should be supported at the regional and global level.", "FAU": ["Phongsavan, Philayrath", "Olatunbosun-Alakija, Ayoade", "Havea, Drew", "Bauman, Adrian", "Smith, Ben J", "Galea, Gauden", "Chen, Jack"], "AU": ["Phongsavan P", "Olatunbosun-Alakija A", "Havea D", "Bauman A", "Smith BJ", "Galea G", "Chen J"], "AD": "Medical Foundation Building, K25, School of Public Health, University of Sydney NSW, 2006 Australia. php@health.usyd.edu.au", "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "DEP": "20050314", "PL": "England", "TA": "Health Promot Int", "JT": "Health promotion international", "JID": "9008939", "SB": "IM", "MH": ["Adolescent", "Diet/statistics & numerical data", "Exercise", "Female", "*Health Behavior", "Health Services/*supply & distribution", "*Health Surveys", "Humans", "*Life Style", "Male", "Pacific Islands", "Risk-Taking", "Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology"], "EDAT": "2005/03/16 09:00", "MHDA": "2005/12/13 09:00", "CRDT": ["2005/03/16 09:00"], "PHST": ["2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]", "2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]", "2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]"], "AID": ["dah612 [pii]", "10.1093/heapro/dah612 [doi]"], "PST": "ppublish", "SO": "Health Promot Int. 2005 Sep;20(3):238-48. doi: 10.1093/heapro/dah612.

Many intra-country initiatives have been established to conduct systematic reviews in their relevant public health areas. The Cochrane Collaboration, an international organisation established to conduct and publish systematic reviews of healthcare interventions, is committed to high quality reviews that are regularly updated, published electronically, and meeting the needs of the consumers. AIMS: To identify global priorities for Cochrane systematic reviews of public health topics. METHODS: Systematic reviews of public health interventions were identified and mapped against global health risks. Global health organisations were engaged and nominated policy-urgent titles, evidence based selection criteria were applied to set priorities. RESULTS: 26 priority systematic review titles were identified, addressing interventions such as community building activities, pre-natal and early infancy psychosocial outcomes, and improving the nutrition status of refugee and displaced populations.

Children with helminthiasis and anaemia were found to be 8.7 times more likely to be stunted and 4.3 times more likely to be underweight than non-anaemic and non-infected children. Four significant environmental influences on helminthiasis were identified: (1) an inadequate water supply; (2); availability of a school canteen; (3) regular water/sanitation maintenance regimes; and (4) overcrowded classrooms. Helminthiasis was found to be strongly associated with anaemia, stunting and underweight and environmental influences identified. Although mass anti-helminthic drug administrations (MDA) have been taking place, reinfection is common as drug therapy alone is not enough.

In some of the Small Island States of the Pacific, internal distribution challenges further reduce access to drugs for those people who live on the outer islands.

RESULTS: Two HBsAg tests (Abbott Auszyme and Ortho HBsAg-3) did not detect HBsAg reactivity amongst the volunteers, although the Abbott Auszyme test results reached 70-80% of the manufacturer's cut-off at day 3 in two volunteers.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with BPH were consecutively enrolled from a clinical urology practice. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), peak urinary flow rate, and prostate volume were assessed at baseline and every 2 months for 12 months. Detrusor pressure at maximum flow was assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 months. Patients were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups - terazosin alone, finasteride alone, or combination therapy. RESULTS: At 12 months, symptom scores had decreased significantly in all 3 treatment groups (p<0.05). Combination therapy resulted in significantly greater reductions in IPSS than terazosin or finasteride (6.4, 4.9, 4.1 points, respectively, p<0.05) There were significant increases in peak urinary flow rate within each treatment group, although there were no significant changes between groups. Detrusor pressure also significantly decreased from baseline within each treatment group. Patients treated with combination therapy had a significantly greater mean decrease in detrusor pressure after 12 months when compared with finasteride-treated patients (16.7 versus 10.5 cm H20, p<0.03). There were no significant differences between terazosin and combination therapy or between terazosin and finasteride despite the relatively greater decrease in detrusor pressure seen in the terazosin group when compared with the finasteride group.

The main findings were that there was no scope for identifying new areas in which to locate new panels or extend the activities of existing panels because the number of donors in an area was closely correlated with population. There was therefore little scope for recruitment of donors by focusing on any particular area.

The authors' pharmacologic erection program, using a fixed combination of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and papaverine, is notable for its simplicity and acceptance by patients who have suffered spinal cord injuries (SCIs). METHODS: Patients undergo baseline questionnaire, physical examination, and hormone profile followed by instruction and injection of a fixed combination of PGE1 and papaverine. On successive visits, the patient injects himself and the dosage is titrated until a satisfactory erection is obtained. Patients who do not respond to injection of 1.0 cc are considered treatment failures. Patients return periodically for routine follow-up. RESULTS: From May 1994 to March 1997, 37 patients with SCI underwent initial evaluation and 28 (76%) responded to injection therapy and were successfully using self-injection therapy at 3-month follow-up. Twenty-three patients are still on injection therapy. Five patients have dropped out for several reasons including a lack of a current sexual partner (60%) and pain with injection (40%). Patient age ranges from 24 to 72. The dosage range was 0.10 to 0.50 cc (mean = 0.29 cc). The average duration of erection was 43 minutes. At 3-month follow-up, 85% of the patients rated their erections as good or excellent. Forty-three percent of patients are using ICI 1 or more times per week. Seventy-seven percent of patients are moderately or extremely satisfied with their treatment and 89% said that they would recommend this program to a friend.

The transfusion laboratory and hospital records were examined and analysed for all transfusion events in Gynaecology and Obstetrics during the three periods of 6 months immediately before, immediately after and 2 1/2-3 years following the introduction of a GS and MSBOS policy in November 1986. The number of units of blood crossmatched and units transfused decreased consistently and progressively to half the pre-GS and MSBOS level in both Gynaecology wards and Obstetrics wards during the study periods. This reduction was not associated with a decrease in the clinical workload. However, the crossmatched/transfused ratio (CTR) showed an immediate but transient improvement (3.6 to 2.2 to 3.4) and only partial and delayed improvement (10.1 to 9.6 to 7.7) with regard to blood use in the Gynaecology wards and the Obstetrics wards (respectively) during the three periods of 6 months indicated above. We conclude that the introduction of a GS and MSBOS policy can have a significant and sustained impact in reducing unnecessary blood ordering.
