    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p><span class="marginnote"><img src="hand-drawn-sketch.jpg" alt="Hand-drawn sketch">This banner was my first experience of the power of Large Language Models—I believe it was GPT 3 at the time—to generate working code from a hand-drawn sketch. Here is the input I gave it, together with a prompt asking it to produce a `p5.js` sketch following the design.</span></p>
<p>In late 2023, I vibe-coded (the term did not exist at the time) a <a href="https://p5js.org/">Processing sketch</a> to serve as a public banner during webinars. I used it to remind participants that the time to the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/un-high-level-meeting-prevention-and-control-noncommunicable-diseases-and-promotion-mental-health">Fourth UN High Level Meeting on NCDs and Mental Health</a> was growing short and that we had a lot to do before then.</p>
<p>I set up this banner when the count was 100, hence the name, but I publish this post when the number has dwindled to six.</p>
<p>The countdown became almost a marker of my own journey to retirement and life after WHO. I will keep this code repository running and switch the label to mark weeks beyond the High Level Meeting—a tiny voice, a reminder, and a conscience-prick to policy-makers and politicians—I assume they have consciences—mutely asking them to accelerate work on their commitments to 2030.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://github.com/gauden/100weeks">Github repo</a> and, in an <code>iframe</code> below, the banner itself, more a reminder now than a call to action.</p>

<p>I started my coding life in the 80s with a ZX Spectrum and a book on Basic. I was hooked. I've been coding ever since. I've worked in a variety of languages and environments, including Hypertalk, Perl, PHP, Processing, Python, R, and ZX Basic (in alphabetical order, because I loved each of them at different times). These days, my mainstay is Python, a happy coincidence given its current dominance in the field of AI. It also explains why I have chosen to use <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a> for this site.</p>
<p>But I will try any new language or framework, just for the thrill. My hard drive is littered with half-finished projects and experiments. Here are a few of them, in no particular order. In recent months I have been able to take them to a fuller stage of completion with the assistance of AI copilots.</p>

      <blockquote><p>In January, 2025, the US Surgeon General released an Advisory on alcohol consumption and cancer risk. He briefly summarised the evidence on alcohol and cancer, including underlying biological mechanisms, and concluded that alcohol use is a leading preventable cause of cancer in the USA and globally, causing around 100 000 and 750 000 cancer cases annually, respectively. The carcinogenicity of alcohol is not a new concept. More than three decades ago, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the Continuous Update Project of the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research concluded that there was sufficient evidence that alcohol causes certain cancers; the current list of alcohol-attributable cancer sites published by IARC includes cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, oesophagus (squamous cell carcinoma), colon, rectum, liver, and intra-hepatic bile duct, larynx, and female breast.</p>

      <blockquote><p>Despite their established effectiveness, uptake of the WHO best buys for tackling non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has been uneven and disappointing. Here we introduce the "quick buys", an evidence-based set of cost-effective interventions with measurable public health impacts within five years. We reviewed 49 interventions previously established as cost-effective (&lt;$I20,000 per disability-adjusted life-year averted) to identify the earliest possible detectable effect on high-level population health targets. Using a strict evidence hierarchy, including Cochrane and systematic reviews, we estimated the effects of each intervention against global targets agreed upon by countries. Quick buys were defined as those interventions that could exhibit measurable effects within 5 years, aligning with average electoral cycles in across the WHO European Region. Of the 49 interventions, 25 qualified as quick buys, including those relating to tobacco (n = 5), alcohol (n = 4), unhealthy diet (n = 3), physical inactivity (n = 1), cardiovascular disease (n = 3), diabetes (n = 4), chronic respiratory disease (n = 1), and cancer (n = 4). These findings not only offer guidance to policymakers deciding on interventions that align with short-term political cycles but also have the potential to accelerate progress to global health targets, particularly the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal of reducing premature NCD mortality by one-third.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <blockquote><p>This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of educational health message and menu default options on a Meal Delivery App (MDA) in nudging consumers towards reduced-salt options in restaurants of China.
We conducted a nudge-based intervention trial on an MDA named ELEME in China.
Along with a control group, five intervention groups were formed utilizing different combinations of the three nudging treatments, including setting up a salt submenu for "reduced salt" default, a salt submenu for "regular salt" default, and a conventional educational health message on the ordering page. We recruited 903 restaurants from cities across different geographic regions and assigned them into either the control group or one of the five intervention groups.
After analyzing 870,942 meal orders, the results showed that the inclusion of a health message on the restaurants' ordering page was not effective to influence consumers to choose reduced-salt dishes (P &gt; 0.1). A salt submenu that explicitly asked for consumers' preference for "reduced salt" or "regular salt" significantly increased consumers' likelihoods of choosing reduced-salt dishes in the unadjusted model (P &lt; 0.1).
Applying choice architecture changes as nudge-based interventions on MDAs were proven to be effective to promote consumers to order reduced salt dishes, and we consider these findings to have real-world implications for policymakers, researchers, and the private sectors.</p>

      <blockquote><p>Innovation leadership in public health has become increasingly crucial in an era of complex global health challenges and rapid technological advancements. This commentary explores the concept of innovation leadership, its importance in public health, and the key factors that influence its effectiveness. As the world grapples with unprecedented health crises and the need for sustainable solutions, the demand for innovation in public health has intensified. However, the sector often struggles to fully embrace innovation due to various factors, including lack of agility, complex regulatory pathways, incompatible organizational culture, and deficient change management skills. At the heart of these challenges lies the critical need for innovation leadership to create an enabling environment that spurs innovation to accelerate health improvements and sustainable public health impact.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <blockquote><p>Current BMI-based measures of obesity can both underestimate and overestimate adiposity and provide inadequate information about health at the individual level, which undermines medically-sound approaches to health care and policy. This Commission sought to define clinical obesity as a condition of illness that, akin to the notion of chronic disease in other medical specialties, directly results from the effect of excess adiposity on the function of organs and tissues. The specific aim of the Commission was to establish objective criteria for disease diagnosis, aiding clinical decision making and prioritisation of therapeutic interventions and public health strategies. To this end, a group of 58 experts—representing multiple medical specialties and countries—discussed available evidence and participated in a consensus development process. Among these commissioners were people with lived experience of obesity to ensure consideration of patients’ perspectives. The Commission defines obesity as a condition characterised by excess adiposity, with or without abnormal distribution or function of adipose tissue, and with causes that are multifactorial and still incompletely understood. We define clinical obesity as a chronic, systemic illness characterised by alterations in the function of tissues, organs, the entire individual, or a combination thereof, due to excess adiposity. Clinical obesity can lead to severe end-organ damage, causing life-altering and potentially life-threatening complications (eg, heart attack, stroke, and renal failure). We define preclinical obesity as a state of excess adiposity with preserved function of other tissues and organs and a varying, but generally increased, risk of developing clinical obesity and several other non-communicable diseases (eg, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, and mental disorders). Although the risk of mortality and obesity-associated diseases can rise as a continuum across increasing levels of fat mass, we differentiate between preclinical and clinical obesity (ie, health  illness) for clinical and policy-related purposes. We recommend that BMI should be used only as a surrogate measure of health risk at a population level, for epidemiological studies, or for screening purposes, rather than as an individual measure of health. Excess adiposity should be confirmed by either direct measurement of body fat, where available, or at least one anthropometric criterion (eg, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, or waist-to-height ratio) in addition to BMI, using validated methods and cutoff points appropriate to age, gender, and ethnicity. In people with very high BMI (ie, &gt;40 kg/m), however, excess adiposity can pragmatically be assumed, and no further confirmation is required. We also recommend that people with confirmed obesity status (ie, excess adiposity with or without abnormal organ or tissue function) should be assessed for clinical obesity. The diagnosis of clinical obesity requires one or both of the following main criteria: evidence of reduced organ or tissue function due to obesity (ie, signs, symptoms, or diagnostic tests showing abnormalities in the function of one or more tissue or organ system); or substantial, age-adjusted limitations of daily activities reflecting the specific effect of obesity on mobility, other basic activities of daily living (eg, bathing, dressing, toileting, continence, and eating), or both. People with clinical obesity should receive timely, evidence-based treatment, with the aim to induce improvement (or remission, when possible) of clinical manifestations of obesity and prevent progression to end-organ damage. People with preclinical obesity should undergo evidence-based health counselling, monitoring of their health status over time, and, when applicable, appropriate intervention to reduce risk of developing clinical obesity and other obesity-related diseases, as appropriate for the level of individual health risk. Policy makers and health authorities should ensure adequate and equitable access to available evidence-based treatments for individuals with clinical obesity, as appropriate for people with a chronic and potentially life-threatening illness. Public health strategies to reduce the incidence and prevalence of obesity at population levels must be based on current scientific evidence, rather than unproven assumptions that blame individual responsibility for the development of obesity. Weight-based bias and stigma are major obstacles in efforts to effectively prevent and treat obesity; health-care professionals and policy makers should receive proper training to address this important issue of obesity. All recommendations presented in this Commission have been agreed with the highest level of consensus among the commissioners (grade of agreement 90–100%) and have been endorsed by 76 organisations worldwide, including scientific societies and patient advocacy groups.</p>

      <blockquote><p>Despite decades of research on alcohol’s harms, the reality remains striking: the health risks of alcohol are largely misunderstood or downplayed, both in the policy arena and by the public. Alcohol is a leading cause of preventable death in the WHO European Region, responsible for nearly 800,000 deaths annually. The consequences extend far beyond the individual drinker, with societal costs that are staggering. In high-income countries, alcohol use is estimated to cost up to 2.6% of GDP annually due to health care expenses, lost productivity, and increased burdens on justice systems. This makes alcohol’s harms not just a public health problem; it is an economic issue and a matter of social justice.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <blockquote><p>Alcohol health-warning labels are a policy option that can contribute to the reduction of alcohol-related harms, but their effects and public perception depend on their content and format. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of health warnings on knowledge that alcohol causes cancer, the perceptions of three different message topics (responsible drinking, general health harm of alcohol, and alcohol causing cancer), and the role of images included with the cancer message.
In this online survey experiment, distributed in 14 European countries and targeting adults of the legal alcohol-purchase age who consumed alcohol, participants were randomly allocated to one of six label conditions using a pseudorandom number generator stratified by survey language before completing a questionnaire with items measuring knowledge and label perceptions. Effect on knowledge was assessed as a primary outcome by comparing participants who had increased knowledge after exposure to labels with the rest of the sample, for the six label conditions. Label perceptions were compared between label conditions as secondary outcomes.
19 110 participants completed the survey and were eligible for analysis. Our results showed that a third of the participants exposed to the cancer message increased their knowledge of alcohol causing cancer (increase for 1131 [32·5%, 95% CI 29·8 to 35·2] of 3409 participants [weighted percentage] for text-only message; increase for 1096 [33·3%, 30·4 to 36·2] of 3198 [weighted percentage] for message inlcuding pictogram; and increase for 1030 [32·5%, 29·6 to 35·4] of 3242 [weighted percentage] for message including graphic image), compared with an increase for 76 (2·4%, -1·2 to 6·0) of 3018 participants who viewed the control message. Logistic regression showed that cancer messages increased knowledge compared with the control label (odds ratio [OR] 20·20, 95% CI 15·88 to 26·12; OR 21·16, 16·62 to 27·38; OR 20·61, 16·19 to 26·68). Cancer messages had the highest perceived impact and relevance, followed by general health harm and responsibility messages. Text-only and pictogram cancer messages were seen as clear, comprehensive, and acceptable, whereas those including an image of a patient with cancer had lower acceptability and the highest avoidance rating of all the labels. The only identified interaction between perceptions and experimental conditions (with gender) indicated higher comprehensibility and acceptability ratings of cancer labels than responsibility messages and control labels by women, with the results reversed in men.
Health warnings are an effective policy option to increase knowledge of alcohol causing cancer, with a generalisable effect across several countries. Europeans consider alcohol health-warning labels to be comprehensible and acceptable, with cancer-specific health warnings having the highest perceived impact and relevance.

      <blockquote><p>WHO has identified climate change as the greatest health threat of the 21st century. The 2015 Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission found that six of nine planetary boundaries had been breached, including land system change, freshwater depletion, and biodiversity loss, with ocean acidification approaching the boundary. These planetary boundaries interact with climate change and will also pose considerable challenges to health. Also, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), are the leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 90% of deaths. Climate change has a range of effects on health, including through exposure to extreme heat, floods, and droughts; air pollution from wildfires; increased risks of a range of infectious diseases and vector-borne diseases; undernutrition; and population displacement. However, the complex relationships between climate change and NCDs are not widely understood. In this Comment, we explore the synergism between climate change and NCDs and also show how climate change mitigation and adaptation actions can also reduce NCD risks.</p>

      <blockquote><p>The WHO Western Pacific region bears disproportionate deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with increased overall NCD proportional mortality over the past two decades. The disease burden of mental health increased, resulting from rapid ageing, enhanced stress, and the COVID-19 pandemic, but it was largely neglected. The highly diverse cultures, religions, political systems, socioeconomic contexts, lifestyles, and environmental factors probably have led to massive disparities across countries in NCD mortality, risk factors, and NCD management. Geographically, East Asia had the lowest NCD mortality whilst Pacific islands had the highest. Economic booms, ageing, nutrition transition, social stress, prevalent tobacco use, and fast-increasing obesity and hyperglycaemia are important drivers of NCDs. Men tended to have more adverse behavioural and metabolic risk factors. Rural residents are catching up with their urban counterparts in metabolic risk factors and conditions. Sustainable strategies tailored to NCD patterns are needed to fight the NCD epidemic and related disparities.</p>

      <blockquote><p>Alcohol increases cancer risk, but less is known about public awareness of this link. This scoping review summarizes recent findings on the public awareness of alcohol as a cancer risk factor in European Union and UK.
Four databases (Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, CINAHL) were searched for papers containing data on awareness of alcohol as cancer risk factor in EU or UK published between January 2017 and December 2022, and complemented with grey literature searches.
In total, 45 studies were included covering 18 EU countries (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden) and UK, presenting data collected between 2009 and 2022. Studies covered general population (17 studied a nationally representative sample), women, health professionals, patients and young people. Awareness of alcohol causing cancer in general was higher and studied more often than awareness of alcohol's impact on specific cancers. Among the EU general population, awareness of the link between alcohol and breast cancer ranged between 10% and 20%, head and neck cancer 15-25%, colorectal and oesophagus cancer 15-45% and liver cancer 40%. Awareness was higher among young people and specialized health professions and lower among women (the latter specifically for the breast cancer).
While awareness rates varied depending on the exact question wording, many studies showed low awareness of the alcohol-cancer link, especially for specific types such as breast and colon cancer. Public should be better informed about alcohol consumption-related cancer risk.</p>

      <blockquote><p>Chinese urban residents consume more salt from meals prepared outside home than in the past. The purpose of this study is to understand Chinese consumer demand for salt reduction as expressed through their orders on meal delivery apps (MDAs), restaurants' willingness to promote salt reduction, and the extent to which restaurants comply with reduced salt requests.
We analyzed consumer comments extracted from 718 restaurants on a Chinese MDA called ELEME for orders made in the July-December 2020 timeframe. A self-designed questionnaire was distributed to the restaurant managers to assess restaurants' attitude towards salt reduction upon signing up for the study, and laboratory validation was conducted to test whether dishes ordered with reduced salt requests by consumers actually contained less salt.
A total of 25,982 (0.7%) orders out of 3,630,798 orders contained consumer comments. Of the consumer comments, 40.6% (10,549) were about requests for less salt in dishes. Totally 91.5% of 421 surveyed restaurants showed a willingness to respond to consumers' reduced salt requests. The median sodium content measured in the reduced-salt dishes by the laboratory was significantly lower than that in their regular salt counterparts (P &lt; 0.05).
We observed substantial consumer demand for salt reduction while ordering meals on the MDA and that restaurants did, in response, reduce the sodium content in the meals they provided. As meals delivered via MDAs comprise an increasing proportion of outside foods consumed, there is an opportunity for public health experts and policy makers to work with MDAs and restaurants to promote healthier food selections.

      <blockquote><p>The rapidly growing field of digital meal delivery platforms has transformed the out of home (OOH) food environment, presenting both opportunities and challenges for public health. This paper introduces the development and potential of a novel digital platform designed for monitoring the OOH food environment. Drawing on publicly available data from meal delivery applications, this platform provides valuable insights into the landscape of digital food offerings, such as the most common restaurants per region, average caloric content per meal type, and energy value per monetary unit. This research addresses the current void in regulations for this digital environment, particularly around food labeling and provision of nutrition information. Even though the platform has significantly improved our understanding of the digital food ecosystem, it highlights gaps, primarily due to the lack of publicly available individual data and inconsistencies in provided information. Despite these challenges, the proposed digital platform holds considerable promise for better understanding the digital food environment, supporting healthier food choices, and informing future policy interventions aimed at regulating the online food environment. This research advocates for mandatory regulations in the digital food sector to ensure comprehensive, comparable, and transparent nutrition information and equality in access to nutritious foods.</p>

      <blockquote><p>Digital tools have an important role to play in meeting the health demands of ageing societies. However, current technological design paradigms often marginalize older people. We adopted a lean, user-centred approach to prototype the Avatar for Global Access to Technology for Healthy Ageing (Agatha), an interactive one-stop shop for healthy ageing promotion. Building on this experience, we present a vision for an integrated approach to "digital healthy ageing". Older people consulted predominantly associated "healthy ageing" with disease avoidance. Digital healthy ageing should take a more holistic approach, covering self-care, prevention, and active ageing. It should also consider social determinants of health in old age, including access to information and digital health literacy, as they interact with poverty, education, access to health services and other structural factors. We use this framework to map out key areas of innovation and explore policy priorities and opportunities for innovation practitioners.</p>

      <blockquote><p>A systematic scoping review of digital contact tracing (DCT) interventions for COVID-19 was conducted to describe the implementation, adoption, use and effectiveness of DCT interventions implemented as part of the COVID-19 response in the Western Pacific Region (WPR). A systematic search identified 341 studies and 128 grey literature sources, of which 18 studies and 41 grey literature sources were included. 17 (46%) WPR countries and areas implemented DCT interventions. Adoption ranged from 14.6% to 92.7% in different adult populations and epidemiological contexts. Trust in authorities, and privacy concerns and beliefs, were the most frequent determinants of adoption and use. Only two studies analysed DCT effectiveness, which showed limited to no effectiveness of DCT interventions in low transmission settings. Overall, there is limited evidence available to evaluate the contribution of DCT to mitigating COVID-19 in the WPR. Preparedness for future health emergencies should include developing robust frameworks for DCT effectiveness evaluations.</p>

      <blockquote><p>The use of digital health technologies was an integral part to China's early response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Existing literatures have analyzed and discussed implemented digital health innovations from the perspective of technologies, whereas how policy mechanisms contributed to the formulation of the digital health landscape for COVID-19 was overlooked. This study aimed to examine the contexts and key mechanisms in China's rapid mobilization of digital health interventions in response to COVID-19, and to document and share lessons learned.
Policy documents were identified and retrieved from government portals and recognized media outlets. Data on digital health interventions were collected through three consecutive surveys administered between 23 January 2020 and 31 March 2020 by China Academy of Information and Communication Technology (CAICT) affiliated to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Participants were member companies of the Internet Health alliance established by MIIT and the National Health Commission (NHC) in June 2016. Self-report digital interventions focusing on social and economic recovery were excluded. Two hundred and sixty-six unique digital health interventions meeting our criteria were extracted from 175 narratives on digital health interventions submitted by 116 participating companies. Thematic analysis was conducted to describe the scope and priority of policies advocating for the use of digital health technologies and the implementation pattern of digital health interventions. Data limitations precluded an evaluation of the impact of digital health interventions over a longer time frame.
Between January and March 2020, national policy directives promoting the use of digital technologies for the containment of COVID-19 collectively advocated for use cases in emergency planning and preparedness, public health response, and clinical services. Interventions to strengthen clinical services were mentioned more than the other two themes ( = 15, 62.5% (15/24)). Using digital technologies for public health response was mentioned much less than clinical services ( = 5, 20.8% (5/24)). Emergency planning and preparedness was least mentioned ( = 4, 16.7% (4/24)). Interventions in support of clinical services disproportionately favored healthcare facilities in less resource-constraint settings. Digital health interventions shared the same pattern of distribution. More digital health technologies were implemented in clinical services ( = 103, 38.7% (103/266)) than that in public health response ( = 91, 34.2% (91/266)). Emergency planning and preparedness had the least self-reported digital health interventions ( = 72, 27.1% (72/266)). We further identified case studies under each theme in which the wide use of digital health technologies highlighted contextual factors and key enabling mechanisms.
The contextual factors and key enabling mechanisms through the use of policy instruments to promote digital health interventions for COVID-19 in China include pathway of policy directives influencing the private sector using a decentralized system, the booming digital health landscape before COVID-19, agility of the public sector in introducing regulatory flexibilities and incentives to mobilize the private sector.</p>

<h2>Acceptance Speech on the Award of DSc (Honoris Causa) by the University of Malta</h2>
<p>Distinguished Chancellor,<br>
Distinguished Rector and Pro-Rectors,<br>
Honourable Minister for Education,<br>
Honourable Parliamentary Secretary for Youth and Sports,<br>
Members of the Academic Body,<br>
Fellow Graduands,<br>
Distinguished Guests,<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>I feel privileged and deeply grateful for the honour that you are
bestowing upon me today.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, I joined the World Health Organization. I have worked
in the Pacific, in Asia, in Europe, and now head the WHO office in
China. I have been privileged in my work to touch the health of hundreds
of millions; and the work is its own reward.</p>
<p>Yet the news that my Alma Mater had chosen to award me this honour
surprised and moved me to the core. It reminded me that fully half my
career has been in Malta and that there was legacy and an abiding link
here, <em>f'din l-art ħelwa</em>. Thank you indeed: Rector, Pro-Rectors,
Senate, Council, Dr Roberta Sammut for your sponsorship, and Prof Julian
Mamo for your oration.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>As I was thinking what to say on this podium, Jin Yong passed away last
month. Jin Yong was a hugely popular writer in China, and a giant of the
<em>wuxia</em> or kung fu chivalry genre. At the recommendation of a friend, I
picked up "A Hero Born", one of his novels, recently out in a new
translation. Immersed in a fantasy world built around the turbulent
years of medieval China, I followed the coming of age of Guo Jing, slow
learner, loyal son, reluctant hero, and ultimately valiant warrior, as
he acquired his skills under the tutelage of his devoted, if sometimes
bungling, <em>shifu</em>, or teachers.</p>
<p>In <em>wuxia</em> literature, one's identity is locked to that of one's
teachers. As I read the book, I reflected on how true this is in real
life and on how much of one's achievements, whether intellectual or
moral, are really due to our <em>shifu</em>. I have been blessed by great
teachers, the greatest of whom are my parents, sitting here in the
audience, but also the members of the MUSEUM society, the brothers and
teachers at De La Salle College, and the academics here, at the
University of Malta, where I acquired my medical degree, where I was
privileged to serve as the Executive Director of the Institute of Health
Care, during its formative years, and where I lectured in public health
at the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery.</p>
<p>The list of my teachers would be endless so I limit myself to naming
three, because they can only be here in spirit, in the hope that none of
the living will feel left out: Prof George Xuereb, the rector under whom
I studied, Father Peter Serracino-Inglott, the rector under whom I was
appointed to the IHC, and Prof Herbert Gilles, the department head who
opened my career up to international health.</p>
<p>As I look back, one other <em>shifu</em> comes to mind. Despite my never having
met him, he provided me with a philosophical framework for everything
that followed. I have learned his moves and made them mine. Kindly allow
me to re-interpret my <em>shifu's</em> lessons for the modern era, as I have
come to think of them after two decades of international work.</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen, reading "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"
by James Joyce, I was amazed to discover my own biography written
decades before I was even born: the hero was another young man, Stephen
Daedalus, searching for identity and purpose, struggling with sin and
sanctity, living in a politically-divided Catholic society on what was
then a relatively poor island nation.</p>
<p>In navigating this world, Stephen learned a set of what I shall describe
as magic <em>gongfu</em> moves, and I shall give them imaginary titles. Let me
call them: The Three Rejections, The Three Defences, and The Three
Aesthetic Criteria.</p>
<p>First, The Three Rejections. James Joyce says:</p>
<blockquote><p>"You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly
by those nets."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He regards nationality, language, and religion as traps to be avoided.
Turning oneself away from country, language, and religion is a difficult
move to understand and to learn. It may seem ungrateful or heretic,
unpatriotic, even offensive to contemplate in this forum. It takes many
years of practice to truly master.</p>
<p>Yet I would argue that the move is easier to understand and even
essential to master in these days. Every time a politician proclaims the
inherent superiority of one race over another, The Three Rejections are
needed. Every time the politics of identity trump the politics of unity,
The Three Rejections are needed. Every time membership of a geographic,
linguistic, or religious category is used to justify a course of action,
then some of our humanity is lost, we chip away at peace and justice, we
put our common future in danger, and The Three Rejections grow ever more
urgent.</p>
<p>Second, The Three Defences. Joyce describes them with these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as
I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I
allow myself to use -- silence, exile, and cunning."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silence grows ever rarer these days. Amid the hubbub of social media, we
need to reclaim the space for creativity, for reflection and learning
amid the noise of the political and social sphere. We need promote our
work, of course, but we also need to let the work speak for itself. We
need to value personal worth over personal brands.</p>
<p>Exile, in turn, is an effort to compete and contribute on a larger
scale, leaving comfort, safety, and familiarity behind. Exile provides a
stage as large as the whole world but affords no back up in case of
failure. In our case, exile has been thrilling but also the hardest
skill to master. Our departure was voluntary. We left a country that we
loved and that has always welcomed us back, but still it was difficult.
I am grateful to my wife and children, also here in the audience today,
who have unstintingly shared the adventure these past two decades.</p>
<p>Cunning was Joyce's third defence. Cunning is not meant here in a
negative sense; it is not manipulation. In my interpretation, cunning,
or street wisdom, an internal style of <em>gongfu</em> or <em>neigong</em>, is
essential to size up one's surroundings, to anticipate the lateral moves
of opponents, to avoid being outmanoeuvred even when outnumbered, to
compete in fraught arenas for scarce resources, to fly lightly along
informal routes in dense bureaucracies, yet never to lose sight of
youth's ideals.</p>
<p>Finally, Joyce, in defining The Three Aesthetic Criteria, adapts a
quotation from Thomas Aquinas thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Three things are needed for beauty: wholeness, harmony, and
radiance."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In academia and in science, ideals of beauty may be particularly
difficult to translate or to master, yet this deeper understanding can
also be attained with practice.</p>
<p>Beauty is inextricably bound to truth, in science as in art. The search
for truth, the garnering and valuing of empirical facts and forging of
the theories that bind them; these are skills that are particularly
under threat these days, from political slant or spin, and from publics
that need simplified explanations consistent with their pre-existing
world view. Much of public health and human development can only be
attained with the participation of the whole of society, with harmonious
operation between actors and ideologies, and with an eye on the ultimate
goal of lasting well-being. When we attain peace, equity, and
well-being, <em>that</em> will be truth and beauty.</p>
<p>Among all these moves, the dearest for me is Harmony, because it is
particularly difficult to attain in a turbulent world, and because it is
essential to fulfilment. I can only wish for all of us gathered here that in our life and work we
may ever seek to know and enjoy the magic of Harmony.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

      <blockquote><p>Tobacco use is a leading but preventable cause of non-communicable diseases and premature death. The legislature has a key role in setting tobacco control policies. Smoking trends are decreasing thanks to the introduction of effective tobacco control policies in Turkey and these policies may have been shaped by how politicians' interpreted social problems that were prominent during the development and implementation of tobacco regulations.
This paper explores the long-term national relationship between tobacco consumption, tobacco control policies and the associated political discourse in Turkey, considering the varying influences through national leadership on this important public health agenda. This relationship is studied by comparing a time series analysis of tobacco consumption trends with a policy analysis of the minutes of deliberations at the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (GNAT).
This study uses Bayesian time series analysis in order investigate whether the tobacco control policies and related activities influenced the annual per adult cigarette consumption in Turkey. We used a novel method to identify change points in tobacco trends and whether they correspond with key policy changes intended to alter usage after adjusting for the effect of other non-policy related covariates, such as the purchasing power. The policy analysis included an examination of the minutes of deliberations at the GNAT-which is the Turkish parliament and unicameral Turkish legislature-1 year before and 1 year after the break years associated with an increase or decrease in tobacco consumption.
Tobacco consumption increased with the encouragement of tobacco production and the entrance of multinational companies in the country in 1976 and 1993, respectively. The National Tobacco Law of 1996 and comprehensive amendments in 2008, including smoke-free public places and tax increases, appear to have helped reduce tobacco consumption in Turkey. The focus of Parliamentary discussions throughout this period changed, becoming less supportive of tobacco over time. However, throughout the period there remained discussions focussing on concerns around the implications for the economy and the privatization agenda, national agriculture and the welfare of farmers. Effective control appears to require certain political ingredients to be implemented: politicians who are well informed on tobacco control measures and understand the range of issues surrounding the policies (not only those directly health-related); and supportive public health information in the community. Evidence-based public health policy should be introduced to the politicians.</p>

      <blockquote><p>This study aims to present information on the surveillance, policy developments, and implementation of physical activity policies in the 28 European Union (EU) countries. Data was collected on the implementation of the EU Recommendation on health-enhancing physical activity (HEPA) across sectors. In line with the monitoring framework proposed in the Recommendation, a questionnaire was designed to capture information on 23 physical activity indicators. Of the 27 EU countries that responded to the survey, 22 have implemented actions on more than 10 indicators, four countries have implemented more than 20 indicators, and one country has fully addressed and implemented all of the 23 indicators of the monitoring framework. The data collected under this HEPA monitoring framework provided, for the first time, an overview of the implementation of HEPA-related policies and actions at the national level throughout the EU. Areas that need more investment are the "Senior Citizens" sector followed by the "Work Environment", and the "Environment, Urban Planning, and Public Safety" sectors. This information also enabled comparison of the state of play of HEPA policy implementation between EU Member States and facilitated the exchange of good practices.</p>

      <blockquote><p>To project the prevalence of obesity across the WHO European region and examine whether the WHO target of halting obesity at 2010 levels by 2025 is achievable.
BMI data were collected from online databases and the literature. Past and present BMI trends were extrapolated to 2025 using a non-linear categorical regression model fitted to nationally representative survey data. Where only 1 year of data was available, a flat trend was assumed. Where no data were available, proxy country data was used adjusted for demographics.
By 2025, obesity is projected to increase in 44 countries. If present trends continue, 33 of the 53 countries are projected to have an obesity prevalence of 20% or more. The highest prevalence is projected for Ireland (43%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 28-58%). Lithuania, Finland, and the Netherlands were each estimated to have an absolute increase of 2 percentage points in the prevalence of obesity between 2015 and 2025.
The quality of BMI data across Europe is highly variable, with fewer than 50% of the 53 countries having measured nationally representative data and often not enough data to interpret projections meaningfully. Nevertheless, the prevalence of obesity in the European Region appears to be increasing in most countries and, with it, the health and economic burden of its associated diseases. This paints a concerning picture of the future burden of obesity-related noncommunicable diseases across the region. Greater and continued effort for the implementation of effective preventive policies and interventions is required from governments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <blockquote><p>Neural tube (NT) formation in the spinal region of the mammalian embryo involves a wave of "zippering" that passes down the elongating spinal axis, uniting the neural fold tips in the dorsal midline. Failure of this closure process leads to open spina bifida, a common cause of severe neurologic disability in humans. Here, we combined a tissue-level strain-mapping workflow with laser ablation of live-imaged mouse embryos to investigate the biomechanics of mammalian spinal closure. Ablation of the zippering point at the embryonic dorsal midline causes far-reaching, rapid separation of the elevating neural folds. Strain analysis revealed tissue expansion around the zippering point after ablation, but predominant tissue constriction in the caudal and ventral neural plate zone. This zone is biomechanically coupled to the zippering point by a supracellular F-actin network, which includes an actin cable running along the neural fold tips. Pharmacologic inhibition of F-actin or laser ablation of the cable causes neural fold separation. At the most advanced somite stages, when completion of spinal closure is imminent, the cable forms a continuous ring around the neuropore, and simultaneously, a new caudal-to-rostral zippering point arises. Laser ablation of this new closure initiation point causes neural fold separation, demonstrating its biomechanical activity. Failure of spinal closure in pre-spina bifida  mutant embryos is associated with altered tissue biomechanics, as indicated by greater neuropore widening after ablation. Thus, this study identifies biomechanical coupling of the entire region of active spinal neurulation in the mouse embryo as a prerequisite for successful NT closure.</p>

      <blockquote><p>Tobacco smoking harms health, so why do people smoke and fail to quit? An explanation originating in behavioural economics suggests a role for time-discounting, which describes how the value of a reward, such as better health, decreases with delay to its receipt. A large number of studies test the relationship of time-discounting with tobacco outcomes but the temporal pattern of this relationship and its variation according to measurement methods remain unclear. We review the association between time-discounting and smoking across (i) the life course, from initiation to cessation, and (ii) diverse discount measures.
We identified 69 relevant studies in Web of Science and PubMed. We synthesized findings across methodologies and evaluated discount measures, study quality and cross-disciplinary fertilization.
In 44 out of 54 studies, smokers more greatly discounted the future than non-smokers and, in longitudinal studies, higher discounting predicted future smoking. Smokers with lower time-discount rates achieved higher quit rates. Findings were consistent across studies measuring discount rates using hypothetical monetary or cigarette reward scenarios. The methodological quality of the majority of studies was rated as 'moderate' and co-citation analysis revealed an isolation of economics journals and a dearth of studies in public health.
There is moderate yet consistent evidence that high time-discounting is a risk factor for smoking and unsuccessful cessation. Policy scenarios assuming a flat rate of population discounting may inadequately capture smokers' perceptions of costs and benefits.</p>

      <blockquote><p>There is an increasing policy commitment to address the avoidable burdens of unhealthy diet, overweight and obesity. However, to design effective policies, it is important to understand why people make unhealthy dietary choices. Research from behavioural economics suggests a critical role for time discounting, which describes how people's value of a reward, such as better health, decreases with delay to its receipt. We systematically reviewed the literature on the relationship of time discounting with unhealthy diets, overweight and obesity in Web of Science and PubMed. We identified 41 studies that met our inclusion criteria as they examined the association between time discount rates and (i) unhealthy food consumption; (ii) overweight and (iii) response to dietary and weight loss interventions. Nineteen out of 25 cross-sectional studies found time discount rates positively associated with overweight, obesity and unhealthy diets. Experimental studies indicated that lower time discounting was associated with greater weight loss. Findings varied by how time discount rates were measured; stronger results were observed for food than monetary-based measurements. Network co-citation analysis revealed a concentration of research in nutrition journals. Overall, there is moderate evidence that high time discounting is a significant risk factor for unhealthy diets, overweight and obesity and may serve as an important target for intervention. © 2016 The Authors Obesity Reviews published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association for the Study of Obesity (IASO).</p>

      <blockquote><p>This paper presents a typology of available evidence to inform physical activity policy. It aims to refine the distinction between three types of evidence relating to physical activity and to compare these types for the purpose of clarifying potential research gaps.
A scoping review explored the extent, range and nature of three types of physical activity-related evidence available in reviews: (I) health outcomes/risk factors, (II) interventions and (III) policy-making. A six-step qualitative, iterative process with expert consultation guided data coding and analysis in EPPI Reviewer 4.
856 Type I reviews, 350 Type II reviews and 40 Type III reviews were identified. Type I reviews heavily focused on obesity issues (18 %). Reviews of a systematic nature were more prominent in the Type II (&gt;50 %). Type III reviews tended to conflate research about policy intervention effectiveness and research about policymaking processes. The majority of reviews came from the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada.
Although evidence gaps exist regarding evidence Types I and II, the most prominent gap regards Type III, i.e. research pertaining to physical activity policymaking. The findings presented herein will be used to inform physical activity policy development and future research.</p>

      <blockquote><p>Tobacco is responsible for the death of 6 million people every year globally, of whom 700 000 are in Europe. Effective policies for tobacco control exist; however, the status of their implementation varies across the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. In order to tackle the tobacco epidemic, action has been taken though the implementation of both legally binding and non-legally binding measures. This article aims to present the achievements and challenges of tobacco control in Europe, focussing on the available legally binding instruments such as the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive at the European Union level. Tobacco still faces heavy lobbying of the tobacco industry, which has systematically contrasted policies to achieve public health objectives. The legal instruments for tobacco control in Europe presented here are not always adequately enforced in all the countries and there is certainly room for improving their implementation. Finally, the need for a strong political commitment towards the end-game of the tobacco epidemic is emphasised.</p>

      <blockquote><p>This overview describes the principles of the 4th edition of the European Code against Cancer and provides an introduction to the 12 recommendations to reduce cancer risk. Among the 504.6 million inhabitants of the member states of the European Union (EU28), there are annually 2.64 million new cancer cases and 1.28 million deaths from cancer. It is estimated that this cancer burden could be reduced by up to one half if scientific knowledge on causes of cancer could be translated into successful prevention. The Code is a preventive tool aimed to reduce the cancer burden by informing people how to avoid or reduce carcinogenic exposures, adopt behaviours to reduce the cancer risk, or to participate in organised intervention programmes. The Code should also form a base to guide national health policies in cancer prevention. The 12 recommendations are: not smoking or using other tobacco products; avoiding second-hand smoke; being a healthy body weight; encouraging physical activity; having a healthy diet; limiting alcohol consumption, with not drinking alcohol being better for cancer prevention; avoiding too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation; avoiding cancer-causing agents at the workplace; reducing exposure to high levels of radon; encouraging breastfeeding; limiting the use of hormone replacement therapy; participating in organised vaccination programmes against hepatitis B for newborns and human papillomavirus for girls; and participating in organised screening programmes for bowel cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer.</p>

      <blockquote><p>Within the World Health Organization-International Atomic Energy Agency (WHO-IAEA) collaboration for delivery of technical assistance to its Member States, the National Cancer Control Programme/Plan (NCCP) Core Capacity Self-Assessment Tool has been used to obtain a simple and quick qualitative overview of national cancer control planning and on-going activities. The NCCP tool was applied in 50 Member States, which were classified as low- and middle-income countries in 2012. Results show that half of these countries reported having officially endorsed an NCCP and 42% were in the process of preparing or updating one. Overall, the most relevant cancer control interventions reported to be partially developed or well established in most countries were related to the cancer prevention, early detection of cervical and breast cancers, as well as diagnosis and treatment of curable cancers. Contrarily, patient's rehabilitation, psychosocial support, human papilloma virus vaccination, breast cancer screening with mammography and control of occupational carcinogens were noted as being in early development phases. The availability of crucial resources to support interventions was perceived to be the highest in upper middle-income countries. These findings highlight specific areas where WHO, IAEA and partners could strengthen collaboration with countries to leverage on-going interventions and improve availability of resources.</p>

This paper projects the future burden of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, type 2 diabetes and seven cancers by 2030 in 53 WHO European Region countries based on current and past body mass index (BMI) trends. It also tests the impact of obesity interventions on the future disease burden.
Secondary data analysis of country-specific epidemiological data using a microsimulation modelling process.
The effect of three hypothetical scenarios on the future burden of disease in 2030 was tested: baseline scenario, BMI trends go unchecked; intervention 1, population BMI decreases by 1%; intervention 2, BMI decreases by 5%.
Quantifying the future burden of major NCDs and the impact of interventions on this future disease burden.
By 2030 in the whole of the European region, the prevalence of diabetes, CHD and stroke and cancers was projected to reach an average of 3990, 4672 and 2046 cases/100 000, respectively. The highest prevalence of diabetes was predicted in Slovakia (10 870), CHD and stroke-in Greece (11 292) and cancers-in Finland (5615 cases/100 000). A 5% fall in population BMI was projected to significantly reduce cumulative incidence of diseases. The largest reduction in diabetes and CHD and stroke was observed in Slovakia (3054 and 3369 cases/100 000, respectively), and in cancers was predicted in Germany (331/100 000).
Modelling future disease trends is a useful tool for policymakers so that they can allocate resources effectively and implement policies to prevent NCDs. Future research will allow real policy interventions to be tested; however, better surveillance data on NCDs and their risk factors are essential for research and policy.</p>

      <blockquote><p>Public-private partnerships with large corporations offer potential benefits to the health sector but many concerns have been raised, highlighting the need for appropriate safeguards. In this paper we propose five tests that public policy makers may wish to apply when considering engaging in such a public-private partnership. First, are the core products and services provided by the corporation health enhancing or health damaging? In some cases, such as tobacco, the answer is obvious but others, such as food and alcohol, are contested. In such cases, the burden of proof is on the potential partners to show that their activities are health enhancing. Second, do potential partners put their policies into practice in the settings where they can do so, their own workplaces? Third, are the corporate social responsibility activities of potential partners independently audited? Fourth, do potential partners make contributions to the commons rather than to narrow programmes of their choosing? Fifth, is the role of the partner confined to policy implementation rather than policy development, which is ultimately the responsibility of government alone?</p>

      <blockquote><p>We estimated the relationship between soft drink consumption and obesity and diabetes worldwide.
We used multivariate linear regression to estimate the association between soft drink consumption and overweight, obesity, and diabetes prevalence in 75 countries, controlling for other foods (cereals, meats, fruits and vegetables, oils, and total calories), income, urbanization, and aging. Data were obtained from the Euromonitor Global Market Information Database, the World Health Organization, and the International Diabetes Federation. Bottled water consumption, which increased with per-capita income in parallel to soft drink consumption, served as a natural control group.
Soft drink consumption increased globally from 9.5 gallons per person per year in 1997 to 11.4 gallons in 2010. A 1% rise in soft drink consumption was associated with an additional 4.8 overweight adults per 100 (adjusted B; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.1, 6.5), 2.3 obese adults per 100 (95% CI = 1.1, 3.5), and 0.3 adults with diabetes per 100 (95% CI = 0.1, 0.8). These findings remained robust in low- and middle-income countries.
Soft drink consumption is significantly linked to overweight, obesity, and diabetes worldwide, including in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
