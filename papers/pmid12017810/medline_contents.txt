{'AB': 'The existing acquisition cost for essential drugs in the Cook Islands, '
       'Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Tuvalu, is sufficiently high '
       'to compromise equitable access to quality drug therapy. The difficulty '
       'of access is further compounded by problems of distance from drug '
       'manufacturers and suppliers, associated with inadequate transport and '
       'communication links. In some of the Small Island States of the '
       'Pacific, internal distribution challenges further reduce access to '
       'drugs for those people who live on the outer islands. Two management '
       'processes to address these problems which have successfully been used '
       'in the past, are the establishment of an essential drug list to '
       'guarantee consistent appropriate treatment, and the introduction of '
       'pooled or bulk purchasing in order to achieve economies of scale. The '
       'major non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the South Pacific include '
       'diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. These diseases, in '
       'association with life-style factors of obesity and smoking result in '
       'significant morbidity and mortality. This paper demonstrates that '
       'collaboration in drug purchasing of a defined list of essential drugs '
       'for hypertension would be beneficial in the South Pacific, and that '
       'the process is a model for achievement of rational drug treatment for '
       'NCDs in isolated small economies.',
