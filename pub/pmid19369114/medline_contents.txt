{'AB': 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: EpiData and Epi Info are often used together '
       'by public health agencies around the world, particularly in developing '
       'countries, to meet their needs of low-cost public health data '
       'management; however, the current open source data management '
       'technology lacks a mobile component to meet the needs of mobile public '
       'health data collectors. The goal of this project is to explore the '
       'opportunity of filling this gap through developing and trial of a '
       'personal digital assistant (PDA) based data collection/entry system. '
       'It evaluated whether such a system could increase efficiency and '
       'reduce data transcription errors for public surveillance data '
       'collection in developing countries represented by Fiji. METHODS: A '
       'generic PDA-based data collection software eSTEPS was developed. The '
       'software and the data collected using it directly interfaces with '
       'EpiData. A field trial was conducted to test the viability of public '
       'health surveillance data collection using eSTEPS. The design was a '
       'randomised, controlled trial with cross-over design. 120 participants '
       'recruited from the Fiji School of Medicine were randomly assigned to '
       'be interviewed by one of six interviewers in one of the two ways: (1) '
       'paper-based survey followed by PDA survey and (2) PDA survey followed '
       'by paper-based survey. Data quality was measured by error rates '
       '(logical range errors/inconsistencies, skip errors, missing values, '
       'date or time field errors and incorrect data type). Work flow and cost '
       'were evaluated in three stages of the survey process: (1) preparation '
       'of data collection instrument, (2) data collection and (3) data entry, '
       'validation and cleaning. User acceptance was also evaluated in the two '
       'groups of participants: (1) data collectors and (2) survey '
       'participants. RESULTS: None of the errors presented in 20.8% of the '
       'paper questionnaires was found in the data set collected using PDA. '
       'Sixty-two percent of the participants perceived that the PDA-based '
       'questionnaire took less time to complete. Data entry, validation and '
       'cleaning for the PDA-based data collection from 120 participants took '
       'a total of 1.5h, a 93.26% reduction of time from 20.5h required using '
       'paper and pen. The cost is also significantly reduced with PDA-based '
       'protocol. Both data collectors and participants prefer to use PDA '
       'instead of paper for data collection. The trial results prove that '
       'eSTEPS is a feasible solution for public health surveillance data '
       'collection in the field. Several deficiencies of the software were '
       'also identified and would be addressed in the next version. '
       'CONCLUSION: eSTEPS offers the potential to meet the need for an '
       'effective mobile public health data collection tool for use in the '
       'field. The eSTEPS field trial proves that PDA was more efficient than '
       'paper for public health survey data collection. It also significantly '
       'reduced errors in data entry. The later benefit was derived from the '
       'software providing its users with the flexibility of building their '
       'own constraints to control the data type, range and logic of data '
       'entry.',
